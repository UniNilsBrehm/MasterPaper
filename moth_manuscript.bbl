      \field{abstract}{The defensive behaviour of moths around street lights was examined at a site where bats feed heavily on moths. The lights had a negative effect on moth defensive behaviour, but a combination of observational techniques (recording the outcome of naturally occurring bat-moth interactions) and experimental techniques (deafening moths by puncturing the tympanal organs) indicated that ultrasound-detecting ears still afforded the moths some protection from bat predation. On average, bats captured 69\% of the moths they attacked. Moths that exhibited evasive behaviour were caught significantly less often than those that did not (52 vs. 2\%). Moths whose tympanic organs had been punctured were significantly easier to catch (requiring fewer attempts) than moths with intact ears, reflecting the fact that significantly more of the eared than the deafened moths showed evasive behaviour (48 vs. 0\%). Overall, the number of captures of deafened moths was higher, though not significantly, than the number of captures of ear..., Le comportement de défense des papillons de nuit autour de lampadaires a été étudié à un endroit où les chauves-souris se nourrissent abondamment de ces papillons. La lumière des lampadaires avait un effet négatif sur le comportement de défense des papillons, mais une combinaison de techniques d'observation (l'enregistrement des résultats d'interactions naturelles entre chauves-souris et papillons) et de techniques expérimentales (assourdissement des papillons par ponction de leurs organes tympaniques) a permis de constater que les organes de perception des ultra-sons garantissaient aux papillons un certain degré de protection contre les chauves-souris. En moyenne, les chauves-souris réussissaient à capturer 69\% des papillons qu'elles attaquaient. Les papillons qui manifestaient un comportement de fuite étaient capturés significativement moins fréquemment que les papillons qui n'avaient pas ce comportement (52 vs. 2\%).

      \field{abstract}{Many night-flying insects perform complex, aerobatic escape maneuvers when echolocating bats initiate attack. Tiger moths couple this kinematic defense with an acoustic reply to a bat's biosonar-guided assault. The jamming hypothesis for the function of these moth sounds assumes that tiger moth clicks presented at high densities, temporally locked to the terminal phase of the bat attack will produce the greatest jamming efficacy. Concomitantly, this hypothesis argues that moths warning bats of bad tasting chemicals sequestered in their tissues should call early to give the bat time to process the meaning of the warning signal and that moths calling at low duty cycles are more likely to employ such an aposematic strategy. We report here the first investigation of a tiger moth assemblage's response to playback of a bat echolocation attack sequence. This assemblage of arctiid moths first answered the echolocation attack sequence 960+/-547 ms (mean +/- s.d.) from the end of the bat attack. The assemblage reached a half-maximum response shortly after the first response, at 763+/-479 ms from the end of the terminal buzz. Tiger moth response reached a maximum at 475+/-344 ms from the end of the sequence; during the approach phase, well before the onset of the terminal buzz. In short, much of tiger moth response to bat attack occurs outside of the jamming hypotheses' predictions. Furthermore, no relationship exists between the duty cycle of a tiger moth's call (and thus the call's probability of jamming the bat) and its temporal response to bat attack. These data call into doubt the assumptions behind the jamming hypothesis as currently stated but do not directly test the functionality of arctiid sounds in disrupting echolocation in bat-moth aerial battles.}

      \field{abstract}{Adaptation of the spike-frequency response to constant stimulation, as observed on various timescales in many neurons, reflects high-pass filter properties of a neuron's transfer function. Adaptation in general, however, is not sufficient to make a neuron's response independent of the mean intensity of a sensory stimulus, since low frequency components of the stimulus are still transmitted, although with reduced gain. We here show, based on an analytically tractable model, that the response of a neuron is intensity invariant, if the fully adapted steady-state spike-frequency response to constant stimuli is independent of stimulus intensity. Electrophysiological recordings from the AN1, a primary auditory interneuron of crickets, show that for intensities above 60 dB SPL (sound pressure level) the AN1 adapted with a time-constant of approximately 40 ms to a steady-state firing rate of approximately 100 Hz. Using identical random amplitude-modulation stimuli we verified that the AN1's spike-frequency response is indeed invariant to the stimulus' mean intensity above 60 dB SPL. The transfer function of the AN1 is a band pass, resulting from a high-pass filter (cutoff frequency at 4 Hz) due to adaptation and a low-pass filter (100 Hz) determined by the steady-state spike frequency. Thus, fast spike-frequency adaptation can generate intensity invariance already at the first level of neural processing.}

      \field{abstract}{The sounds generated by the metathoracic tymbal organs of the arctiid moth Meles laodamia Druce are described and related to their structure. Each tymbal is a swollen air-filled katepisternal sclerite with a vertical band of 15 to 20 striae on its anterior outer face. When compressed vertically by the basalar musculature it buckles inwards along the line of the striated band, which may be regarded as a linear array of 'microtymbals '. Each stria produces a click which excites the whole structure into damped resonance and yields a brief pulse of sound with a half-decay time of about 80 $\mu$s. Muscle contraction and relaxation produce a cycle of modulation both of pulse repetition rate, up to 1200/s, and of frequency over about an octave as a result of stress changes in the band. The audible fundamental component is relatively weak, and most energy is generated between 30 and 90 kc/s. Bursts of tymbal activity comprise from one to 20 modulation cycles. The acoustic performance of the tymbal organ is compared to that of a simple mechanical model. Previous accounts of the structures are summarized and the possible significance of the sounds discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{Plant-produced 1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine ester alkaloids and their N-oxides (PAs) not only cause acute poisoning of humans and livestock, but also the likely harmful cryptic effects of chronic exposure pose particular food safety risks that need to be addressed for consumer protection. In natural contexts, however, PAs cause few or no problems. Rather, these plant secondary metabolites are important elements of ecosystems and plant–{}animal relationships; the existence and persistence of many PA-adapted organisms, in various ways, depends on the presence of PA-containing plants or even on PAs as such. PA plants are widely distributed among unrelated families of the plant kingdom; there is great structural diversity of PAs, and the amounts of PAs produced are subject to great variation due to multiple causes. These realities, coupled with many deficiencies in our scientific understanding, make the presence and roles of PAs in nature a subject with limited potential for valid generalisations and predictions, and complex and difficult to summarise. PAs, their producer plants and their users are integral parts of ecosystems worldwide, and we have to learn to live with these allelochemicals by accepting the presence of some harmful natural chemicals in the environment and by taking regulatory action to reduce health risks to humans. Regulations for consumer protection are long overdue. However, any such measures must be flexible enough to accommodate the findings of future research. Transdisciplinary efforts are required to fill gaps in the knowledge and to come up with additional means to monitor the presence of PAs in food and feed.}

      \field{abstract}{The intimate details regarding the coevolution of bats and moths have been elucidated over the past 50 years. The bat-moth story began with the evolution of bat sonar, an exquisite ultrasonic system for tracking prey through the night sky. Moths countered with ears tuned to the high frequencies of bat echolocation and with evasive action through directed turns, loops, spirals, drops, and power dives. Some bat species responded by moving the frequency and intensity of their echolocation cries away from the peak sensitivity of moth ears, and the arms race was on. Tiger moths countered by producing anti-bat sounds. Do the sounds advertise moth toxicity, similar to the bright coloration of butterflies; do they startle the bat, giving the moth a momentary advantage in their aerobatic battle; or do they jam the sonar of the bat? The answer is yes. They do all and more in different situations and in different species. Any insect that flies at night must deal with bat predation. Beetles, mantids, true crickets, m...}

      \field{abstract}{Skip to Next Section The tiger moth Bertholdia trigona is the only animal in nature known to defend itself by jamming the sonar of its predators –{} bats. In this study we analyzed the three-dimensional flight paths and echolocation behavior of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) attacking B. trigona in a flight room over seven consecutive nights to determine the acoustic mechanism of the sonar-jamming defense. Three mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the phantom echo hypothesis, which states that bats misinterpret moth clicks as echoes; (2) the ranging interference hypothesis, which states that moth clicks degrade the bats' precision in determining target distance; and (3) the masking hypothesis, which states that moth clicks mask the moth echoes entirely, making the moth temporarily invisible. On nights one and two of the experiment, the bats appeared startled by the clicks; however, on nights three through seven, the bats frequently missed their prey by a distance predicted by the ranging interference hypothesis ($\sim$15–{}20 cm). Three-dimensional simulations show that bats did not avoid phantom targets, and the bats' ability to track clicking prey contradicts the predictions of the masking hypothesis. The moth clicks also forced the bats to reverse their stereotyped pattern of echolocation emissions during attack, even while bats continued pursuit of the moths. This likely further hinders the bats' ability to track prey. These results have implications for the evolution of sonar jamming in tiger moths, and we suggest evolutionary pathways by which sonar jamming may have evolved from other tiger moth defense mechanisms.}

      \field{abstract}{The simple auditory system of noctuoid moths has long been a model for anti-predator studies in neuroethology, although these ears have rarely been experimentally stimulated by the sounds they would encounter from naturally attacking bats. We exposed the ears of five noctuoid moth species to the pre-recorded echolocation calls of an attacking bat (Eptesicus fuscus) to observe the acoustic encoding of the receptors at this critical time in their defensive behaviour. The B cell is a non-tympanal receptor common to all moths that has been suggested to respond to sound, but we found no evidence of this and suggest that its acoustic responsiveness is an artifact arising from its proprioceptive function. The A1 cell, the most sensitive tympanal receptor in noctuid and arctiid moths and the only auditory receptor in notodontid moths, encodes the attack calls with a bursting firing pattern to a point approximately 150 ms from when the bat would have captured the moth. At this point, the firing of the A1 cell reduces to a non-bursting pattern with longer inter-spike periods, suggesting that the moth may no longer express the erratic flight used to escape very close bats. This may be simply due to the absence of selection pressure on moths for auditory tracking of bat echolocation calls beyond this point. Alternatively, the reduced firing may be due to the acoustic characteristics of attack calls in the terminal phase and an acoustic maneuver used by the bat to facilitate its capture of the moth. Although the role of less sensitive A2 cell remains uncertain in the evasive flight responses of moths it may act as a trigger in eliciting sound production, a close-range anti-bat behaviour in the tiger moth, Cycnia tenera.}

      \field{abstract}{SummaryThe simple ears of months have responded evolutionarily to the varied levels of selection pressure exerted upon them by insectivorous bats. While frequency-matched (syntonic) bats exert the primary pressure that determines where a sypatric moth's best frequency (BF) lies, there are bats that echolocate in mismatched (allotonic) bandwidths forming selection pressures strong enough to warrant increased secondary sensitivity at these frequencies. It is unknown what neural mechanism is used by these insects to broaden their audiograms but for some neotropical moths, external hearing aids provide a mechanical means of obtaining this sensitivity. Recent studies have uncovered social uses for auditory systems in certain moths and these requirements may provide additional selection pressure. Auditory conditions exist in certain moths that should provide a means to study the evolution of this sensory system from its mechanoreceptor origins to its degeneration in the absence of bat predation.}

      \field{abstract}{Seventeen of the 24 species of Nearctic Arctiidae which we examined produced sounds under a variety of tactile and acoustic stimuli. Seven of 14 sound-producing species tested emitted their sounds in response to the hunting cries of insectivorous bats or simulations thereof. The sounds were generated by the buckling action of the microtymbal band (=strained band) on the surface of the modified thoracic metepisternum (=tymbal). Sound production is not dependent on the presence of microtymbals as four species of Callarctia possessed nonstriated, functional tymbals. In contrast, other species possessed striated, apparently nonfunctional tymbals. The sounds of the arctiids we studied were predominantly ultrasonic ($>$20 kHz) and relatively faint ($<$85 dB at 2 cm) compared with other insect sounds. The acoustic parameters of the arctiids surveyed revealed extremely high levels of variability in the sound. Smaller species generally emit higher pulse repetition rates and more intense signals than larger ones. The behavioural contexts in which the sounds are produced and their relation to arctiid defense are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{It has been proposed that the most sensitive auditory receptor cell (A1) in the two-celled ears of certain noctuoid moths is inhibited by its partner, the A2 cell, at high stimulus intensities. We used the single-celled ears of notodontid moths, also noctuoids, to test this hypothesis. The A1 cells of all but one of the moths tested exhibited non-monotonic firing rates, with reduced firing rates at high stimulus intensities and showing no relationship to the firing rate of the only other receptor, the non-auditory B cell. These results challenge the peripheral interaction hypothesis for A1 firing patterns in two-celled moth ears. An examination of notodontid A1 adaptation rates and laser vibrometry results suggests that receptor adaptation and tympanal motion non-linearity are more likely explanations for the non-monotonic receptor firing observed in both single- and multi-celled moth ears.}

      \field{abstract}{1. Certain species of tiger moths emit clicks when stimulated by bat-like sounds. These clicks are generated by modified thoracic episterna (tymbals) (Fig. 1) and constitute a rhythmic behaviour activated by simple sensory input. 2. Tymbal periods are indirectly related to stimulus intensity and periods (Fig. 3). Moths initiate sounds with the tymbal opposite to the stimulated ear and once a sequence commences it continues in an undisrupted fashion. 3. The tymbal is innervated by a pleural branch (IIIN2a) of the metathoracic leg nerve, a similar anatomy to that in the unmodified episterna of silent moths (Fig. 5). Backfills of the IIIN2a in Cycnia tenera reveal sensory fibres and a cluster of 5-9 motor neurons with densely overlying dendritic fields (Fig. 6). 4. Extracellular recordings of the IIIN2a reveal a large impulse preceding each tymbal sound (Fig. 7). I suggest that this impulse results from the synchronous firing of 2-3 motor neurons and is the motor output of the tymbal central pattern generator (CPG). The spikes alternate (Figs. 9, 10) and are bilaterally co-related (Fig. 11) but with an phase asymmetry of 2-3 ms (Fig. 12). 5. Normal motor output continues in the absence of tymbal sounds (Fig. 13) and when all nerve-tymbal connections are severed (Fig. 14, Table 1) therefore this CPG operates independent of sensory feedback. A model is proposed for the tymbal circuitry based upon the present data and the auditory organization of related noctuid moths (Fig. 15). I propose that the tymbal response in modern arctiids evolved from either flight or walking CPGs and that preadaptive circuitry ancestral to tymbal movements still exists in modern silent Lepidoptera.}

      \field{abstract}{Skip to Next Section Echolocation in bats and high-frequency hearing in their insect prey make bats and insects an ideal system for studying the sensory ecology and neuroethology of predator–{}prey interactions. Here, we review the evolutionary history of bats and eared insects, focusing on the insect order Lepidoptera, and consider the evidence for antipredator adaptations and predator counter-adaptations. Ears evolved in a remarkable number of body locations across insects, with the original selection pressure for ears differing between groups. Although cause and effect are difficult to determine, correlations between hearing and life history strategies in moths provide evidence for how these two variables influence each other. We consider life history variables such as size, sex, circadian and seasonal activity patterns, geographic range and the composition of sympatric bat communities. We also review hypotheses on the neural basis for anti-predator behaviours (such as evasive flight and sound production) in moths. It is assumed that these prey adaptations would select for counter-adaptations in predatory bats. We suggest two levels of support for classifying bat traits as counter-adaptations: traits that allow bats to eat more eared prey than expected based on their availability in the environment provide a low level of support for counter-adaptations, whereas traits that have no other plausible explanation for their origination and maintenance than capturing defended prey constitute a high level of support. Specific predator counter-adaptations include calling at frequencies outside the sensitivity range of most eared prey, changing the pattern and frequency of echolocation calls during prey pursuit, and quiet, or `stealth', echolocation.}

      \field{abstract}{Animals that rely on acoustic communication to find mates, such as grasshoppers, are astonishingly accurate in recognizing song patterns that are specific to their own species 1,2 . This raises the question of whether they can also solve a far more complicated task that might provide a basis for mate preference and sexual selection: to distinguish individual songs by detecting slight vari-ations around the common species-specific theme. Using spike-train discriminability to quantify the precision of neural responses from the auditory periphery of a model grasshopper species, we show that information sufficient to distinguish songs is readily available at the single-cell level when the spike trains are analyzed on a millisecond time scale. To investigate whether information about variations between conspecific songs is available for discrimination, we made electrophysiological recordings in Chorthippus biguttulus females and recorded spike trains from single auditory receptors in response to songs from different conspecific males (Fig. 1a and b). To eliminate simple discrimination cues such as vari-ations in syllable length, we also recorded responses to songs that were rescaled to have a common syllable duration and car-rier spectrum. To obtain these song variants, the original ampli-tude modulations were calculated using the Hilbert transform 3 , rescaled in time, and then combined with the spectrum of one of the songs (Fig. 1c). The resulting mean firing rates are indis-tinguishable (Fig. 1d). Successful discrimination would demand that spike trains elicit-ed by repeated presentations of the same song be more similar to each other than spike trains elicited by different songs (Fig. 1d). To compute the similarity between two spike trains, each spike was replaced by a function f(t) that mimics the time course of an exci-tatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in a hypothetical downstream neuron of the grasshopper's auditory system (Fig. 1e). A distance between the two spike trains was then defined as the mean square distance between their EPSP-convolved traces 4 . By varying the width ($\tau$) of the EPSP function, effects of the temporal resolution can be studied: if $\tau$ is large, only differences in the average spike rate contribute to the distance measure; if $\tau$ is small, even small differences in spike timing matter. We analyzed responses to songs from eight Ch. biguttulus males. For each song, one spike train was arbitrarily chosen as a template. The remaining spike trains were classified by assigning each one to the closest of the eight templates. Averages were then computed by permuting all possible template choices, yielding classification matri-ces (Fig. 2a). The diagonal elements of the matrices correspond to correctly classified spike trains, and the off-diagonal elements to misclassified spike trains. When insisting on a very high time reso-lution ($\tau$ $\leq$ 1 ms) or when largely neglecting temporal informa-tion ($\tau$ $\geq$ 100 ms), the songs cannot be discriminated well, as brief communications nature neuroscience •{} volume 6 no 4 •{} april 2003 341 Fig. 1. Acoustic communication signals, artificial songs and sample responses. (a) Grasshoppers produce species-specific sound patterns by rasping their hindlegs across their forewings. Shown are songs generated by one Chorthippus mollis and two Chorthippus biguttulus males. Each song consists of many repetitions of a basic pattern, termed 'syllable'. Scale bar, 500 ms. (b) Within each syllable, the amplitude of the high-frequency broadband carrier is strongly modulated in time as illustrated by the two spectrograms. (c) Equalizing the song spectra and rescaling the length of each syllable to 100 ms yields artificial songs that differ only in their ampli-tude modulation. (d) Spike raster plots of responses from a single audi-tory receptor to five presentations of the two songs shown in (c). (e) The EPSP function f(t) = t * exp(–$\alpha$t) used to compute spike-train distances. The full width at half maximum, $\tau$, is $\tau$ $\approx$ 2.45/$\alpha$. Details of the experimental protocols, which complied with German law governing animal care, are described elsewhere 5 . Stimulus intensities were 50–{}70 dB SPL, yielding spike rates between 100 and 200 Hz; temperature during the measure-ment was 33–{}35 $^\circ$C. Responses to at least six repetitions of the rescaled songs were recorded from n = 18 receptors; for three of these neurons, responses to the original songs were also obtained. a b c d e 342 nature neuroscience •{} volume 6 no 4 •{} april 2003 indicated by the many off-diagonal entries in the corresponding matrices. For $\tau$ $\approx$ 5 ms, however, most spike trains are correctly assigned, suggesting that this time scale corresponds to unique song features that auditory receptors accurately encode. Signal variations on a scale of a few milliseconds are thus well suited for song eval-uation; downstream neurons with much longer EPSPs will hardly be able to process the information relevant for discrimination. To investigate how the discrimination ability unfolds in time, we computed how many spike trains are correctly classified as a function of both the spike-train length T and EPSP width $\tau$ (con-tour plot in Fig. 2b). Already at T = 400 ms, after just a few syl-lables or roughly 50 action potentials, the songs are correctly recognized in over 80\% of all trials. Differences in the songs' amplitude modulations, syllable length and carrier spectrum all contribute to this surprisingly rapid and accurate discrimination. Notably, variations in spectral composition often lead to different firing rates, thereby facilitating discrimination. Successful discrimination of the rescaled songs with equal-ized carrier spectrum and uniform syllable length, however, must be based solely on differences in the detailed structure of amplitude modulations within a syllable. Nevertheless, the neural performance does not decrease substantially (Fig. 2c and d). For small T or very small $\tau$, discrimination may even slightly improve as the adjusted spectra lead to higher firing rates and lower trial-to-trial spike time variability for some of the songs. Together, our results show that auditory receptor neurons react to rapid amplitude modulations with high tem-poral accuracy, so even slight differences among stimuli can be recovered. This finding coincides with the observation that quickly varying stimuli lead to greater precision in receptor spike timing than slowly varying stimuli 5 , just as neocortical neurons respond more precisely to fluctuating current injec-tions than to constant currents 6 . Our data indicate that short segments of single spike trains from one auditory receptor suffice to rapidly discriminate the songs of conspecific grasshoppers, provided that a time reso-lution of a few milliseconds is maintained. With 40–{}50 recep-tors per ear, even more information is available for spike-time based computations by downstream neurons. That the female grasshopper's auditory system could, in principle, distinguish individual male songs does not prove, however, that female grasshoppers use this capability. But if near-perfect discrimi-nation is possible, then so is the easier task of preferring cer-tain male songs over others, which female grasshoppers do 7 . The precise role of song discriminability in sexual selection remains an open question for further investigation.}

      \field{abstract}{In hearing insects, discrimination of auditory signals is vital to mate selection. We tested the capability of single auditory receptor neurons to discriminate calling songs from di!erent individual grasshoppers of the same species. Spike trains elicited from di!erent songs were studied using the metric-space analysis of Victor and Purpura (Networks: Comput. Neural Syst. 8 (1997) 127\vphantom\{\}164). Our data show that the natural songs can be distinguished perfectly after a mere 100 msec if spike trains are evaluated on time scales of about 10 msec. This time scale is well matched to the temporal structure of the grasshopper songs.}

      \field{abstract}{Abstract Active echolocation enables bats to orient and hunt the night sky for insects. As a counter-measure against the severe predation pressure many nocturnal insects have evolved ears sensitive to ultrasonic bat calls. In moths bat-detection was the principal purpose of hear- ing, as evidenced by comparable hearing physiology with best sensitivity in the bat echolocation range, 20–{}60 kHz, across moths in spite of diverse ear morphology. Some eared moths subsequently developed sound-producing organs to warn/startle/jam attacking bats and/or to com- municate intraspecifically with sound. Not only the sounds for interaction with bats, but also mating signals are within the frequency range where bats echolocate, indicating that sound communication developed after hearing by ``sensory exploitation''. Recent findings on moth sound communica- tion reveal that close-range (\textasciitilde{} a few cm) communication with low-intensity ultrasounds ``whispered'' by males dur- ing courtship is not uncommon, contrary to the general notion of moths predominantly being silent. Sexual sound communication in moths may apply to many eared moths, perhaps even a majority. The low intensities and high fre- quencies explain that this was overlooked, revealing a bias towards what humans can sense, when studying (acoustic) communication in animals.}

      \field{abstract}{The receptor mechanism mediating the avoidance behaviour of flying noctuid moths in response to brief ultrasonic pulses may require only a single pair of acoustic sense cells, one A1 cell in each tympanic organ (Roeder, 1966c). Introduction of the fluorescent dye, procion yellow, into the nerve fibres leaving the tympanic organ has allowed the reconstruction of the central morphology of A1, the more sensitive of the two acoustic cells. The A1 axon follows a superficial course for the first ???100 ?? auterior to its dorsal root of entry (3N1) into the thoracic ganglia, then plunges ventrally into the posterior mesothoracic neuropil where it branches. The posterior part reaches through two-thirds of the metathoracic ganglion. The anterior branch bifurcates in the anterior mesothoracic ganglion to give rise to a posteriorly directed branch extending through the ventral mesothoracic neuropil and an anterior branch which passes through the connective into the posterior half of the prothoracic ganglion. Here it ramifies along the midline. The cell remains strictly ipsi-lateral with numerous processes extending right up to the midline in the ventral neuropil of all three ganglia. This morphology correlates well with the map of sites from which A1 acoustic responses can be recorded in the central nervous system. ?? 1973.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper deals with some measurements concerning the threshold versus duration for tone pulses. A new hypothesis is introduced: Switching on a tone pulse of intensity I results in an effect s somewhere in the hearing pathway, that approaches its final value asymptotically according to an exponential function; this final value is proportional to I; perception occurs when s exceeds a critical value so. The experiments show that this hypothesis gives a better description than the hypotheses thus far used. The time constant varies from ca 375 msec at 250 cps to ca 150 msec at 8000 cps. For short pulse durations the data deviate from the hypothesis. This deviation can be explained by the assumption that energy integration around each fre- quency is restricted to a fixed band width. A formula is derived which gives a correction to the mentioned relationship for short durations. In this way the band width at the different test frequencies could be deter- mined. The general course of this band width as a function of frequency agrees with the "Kopplungsbreite" after Gässler.}

      \field{abstract}{We studied the efficiency and effects of the multiple sensory cues of tiger moths on echolocating bats. We used the northern long-eared bat, Myotis septentrionalis, a purported moth specialist that takes surface-bound prey (gleaning) and airborne prey (aerial hawking), and the dogbane tiger moth, Cycnia tenera, an eared species unpalatable to bats that possesses conspicuous colouration and sound-producing organs (tymbals). This is the first study to investigate the interaction of tiger moths and wild-caught bats under conditions mimicking those found in nature and to demand the use of both aerial hawking and gleaning strategies by bats. Further, it is the first to report spectrograms of the sounds produced by tiger moths while under aerial attack by echolocating bats. During both aerial hawking and gleaning trials, all muted C. tenera and perched intact C. tenera were attacked by M. septentrionalis, indicating that M. septentrionalis did not discriminate C. tenera from palatable moths based on potential echoic and/or non-auditory cues. Intact C. tenera were attacked significantly less often than muted C. tenera during aerial hawking attacks: tymbal clicks were therefore an effective deterrent in an aerial hawking context. During gleaning attacks, intact and muted C. tenera were always attacked and suffered similar mortality rates, suggesting that while handling prey this bat uses primarily chemical signals. Our results also show that C. tenera temporally matches the onset of click production to the ;approach phase' echolocation calls produced by aerial hawking attacking bats and that clicks themselves influence the echolocation behaviour of attacking bats. In the context of past research, these findings support the hypotheses that the clicks of arctiid moths are both an active defence (through echolocation disruption) and a reliable indicator of chemical defence against aerial-hawking bats. We suggest these signals are specialized for an aerial context.}

      \field{abstract}{Echolocating bats and eared moths are a model system of predator-prey interaction within an almost exclusively auditory world. Through selective pressures from aerial-hawking bats, noctuoid moths have evolved simple ears that contain one to two auditory neurons and function to detect bat echolocation calls and initiate defensive flight behaviours. Among these moths, some chemically defended and mimetic tiger moths also produce ultrasonic clicks in response to bat echolocation calls; these defensive signals are effective warning signals and may interfere with bats' ability to process echoic information. Here, we demonstrate that the activity of a single auditory neuron (the A1 cell) provides sufficient information for the toxic dogbane tiger moth, Cycnia tenera, to decide when to initiate defensive sound production in the face of bats. Thus, despite previous suggestions to the contrary, these moths' only other auditory neuron, the less sensitive A2 cell, is not necessary for initiating sound production. However, we found a positive linear relationship between combined A1 and A2 activity and the number of clicks the dogbane tiger moth produces.}

      \field{abstract}{Insect-eating bats find their aerial food by sonar, through emitting ultrasonic chirps and locating sources of echoes. Certain moths have ears sensitive to these chirps and can detect bats well beyond the range of the bats' sonar. On hearing a distant bat, many moths turn and fly directly away from the source of ultrasound. Only one sense cell in each ear of a moth provides the primary nervous information for this response. This article describes my initial attempts to find out how a moth's central nervous system processes the train of chirps reaching its two ears. The ear of a restrained moth is exposed to a sequence of artifically generated ultrasonic pulses that approximates the cries made by a bat. This stimulus can be varied with respect to ultrasonic frequency (pitch), pulse intensity, pulse duration, the interval between pulses, and pulse-train duration. The more sensitive acoustic sense cell responds to all frequencies between about 15,000 and 80,000 cycles per second, but the signal that it transmits to the moth's central nervous system contains no measure of frequency within this range. However, this nerve signal reports variations in the other parameters of the stimulus. The acoustic fiber connects, in the central nervous system, with various nerve cells that transform the signal farther. The signal from a pulse-marker neuron contains no measures of pulse intensity or pulse duration, reporting only changes in interpulse interval and pulse-train duration. A train-marker neuron reports only the duration of the pulse train. The stimulus parameters may be likened to keys, each of which is necessary to gain admittance through a given door but becomes superfluous once this door has been passed. This analogy suggests one of the ways in which a signal is transformed in its passage through the nervous system, and how its specificity is assured in eliciting a given response. In addition to undergoing this kind of transformation, neural signals generated in the two directionally sensitive ears must be combined if a flying moth is to steer a course away from a distant bat. Neurons have been discovered in the central ganglia which summate signals from the right and left ears. Other neurons are inhibited in their activity by stimulation of one ear. The moth may combine signals from these neurons with motor-nerve information on the attitude of its own wings, which act as oscillating baffles modifying its directional acoustic sensitivity 20 to 40 times a second as it flaps an erratic path through the darkness.}

      \field{abstract}{The discrimination between two spike trains is a fundamental problem for both experimentalists and the nervous system itself. We introduce a measure for the distance between two spike trains. The distance has a time constant as a parameter. Depending on this parameter, the distance interpolates between a coincidence detector and a rate difference counter. The dependence of the distance on noise is studied with an integrate-andfire model. For an intermediate range of the time constants, the distance depends linearly on the noise. This property can be used to determine the intrinsic noise of a neuron.}

      \field{abstract}{Euchaetes egle Drury andE. bolteri Stretch produce ultrasound using paired thoracic tymbal organs in both defensive and sexual contexts. The defensive ultrasound produced in response to tactile stimulation is fully characterized. The sounds are sexually monomorphic and species specific in the number of sound pulses produced during each flexion and relaxation of the tymbal, peak frequency, peak intensity, and duration of the interval between flexion and relaxation. Ultrasonic signals play a role in the courtship of both species. Males produce ultrasound just prior to contact with females, and it is shown to be important to courtship success inE. egle. Ultrasonic courtship communication is mapped on a recently proposed cladogram for the family Arctiidae. The use of ultrasound in courtship has evolved on at least three occasions within the family.}

      \field{abstract}{Phase locking of neural firing is ubiquitously observed in the brain and occurs when neurons fire at a particular phase of a periodic signal. Here we study in detail how spikes of single neurons can simultaneously lock to multiple distinct frequencies at the example of p-type electroreceptor afferents in the electrosensory system of the Gymnotiform weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. We identify key elements for multiple frequency locking, study its determining factors and limits, and provide concise mathematical models reproducing our main findings. Our findings provide another example how rate and temporal codes can coexist and complement each other in single neurons, and demonstrate that sensory coding in p-type electroreceptor afferents provides a much richer representation of the sensory environment than commonly assumed. Since the underlying mechanisms are not specific to the electrosensory system, our results could provide the basis for studying multiple-frequency locking in other systems.}

      \field{abstract}{Temporal coding in the moth ear was inferred from the response of the auditory receptor to acoustic stimuli with different temporal characteristics. 1. Determinations of the threshold with different stimulus pulse durations showed that the moth ear behaves as an energy detector with a maximum time constant (the integration time) of 25 ms. Pulse durations beyond this value did not result in decreased thresholds (Fig. 1). 2. The synchronization to amplitude modulations was determined by stimulating the moth ear with amplitude modulated (AM) tones (carrier frequency: 40 kHz) and AM white noise presented as 450 ms pulses separated by pauses of similar length. The modulation depth was constant (100\%) whereas the modulation frequency,f m, was varied. The maximumf m which the auditory receptors could follow was 200 Hz (P$<$0.05) (Figs. 2, 3, 4). 3. The relatively broad tuning of the only receptor which was functional at the relevant stimulus intensities suggested that AM detection could only be based on temporal cues. This was confirmed by the results showing the same degree of synchronization independent of carrier. 4. A minimum time constant for the receptor was also determined by interrupting a 400 ms noise pulse by a gap (Figs. 5, 6). The threshold for gap detection of the moth ear was ca. 2 ms on a 2.5\% significance level (one sided test). 5. The temporal acuity reported here seems to be fine enough to explain the temporal resolution suggested by behavioral results from other insect species. The results are discussed in relation to acoustic communication in insects as well as in relation to temporal resolution in vertebrates.}

      \field{abstract}{Insects with bat-detecting ears are ideal animals for investigating sensory system adaptations to predator cues. Noctuid moths have two auditory receptors (A1 and A2) sensitive to the ultrasonic echolocation calls of insectivorous bats. Larger moths are detected at greater distances by bats than smaller moths. Larger moths also have lower A1 best thresholds, allowing them to detect bats at greater distances and possibly compensating for their increased conspicuousness. Interestingly, the sound frequency at the lowest threshold is lower in larger than in smaller moths, suggesting that the relationship between threshold and size might vary across frequencies used by different bat species. Here, we demonstrate that the relationships between threshold and size in moths were only significant at some frequencies, and these frequencies differed between three locations (UK, Canada and Denmark). The relationships were more likely to be significant at call frequencies used by proportionately more bat species in the moths' specific bat community, suggesting an association between the tuning of moth ears and the cues provided by sympatric predators. Additionally, we found that the best threshold and best frequency of the less sensitive A2 receptor are also related to size, and that these relationships hold when controlling for evolutionary relationships. The slopes of best threshold versus size differ, however, such that the difference in threshold between A1 and A2 is greater for larger than for smaller moths. The shorter time from A1 to A2 excitation in smaller than in larger moths could potentially compensate for shorter absolute detection distances in smaller moths.}

      \field{abstract}{Temporal integration in the Al acoustic receptor cell of noctuid moths (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was studied. This was done by recording from the auditory nerve of Spodoptera littoralis and Noctua pronuba while stimulating with short-duration tone pulses. Consistent with previous experiments of the same kind, a decrease in threshold was observed with increasing stimulus duration. These threshold improvements, however, were larger than expected from an energy detector model of the receptor based on previous experiments with double clicks. This difference was analysed and could be attributed to a bias introduced by the choice of threshold criterion. If a fixed number of spikes elicited per stimulation is used as criterion, this will tend to lower the measured thresholds for long durations because for long stimuli, more time is available for accumulation of the spikes needed to exceed the criterion. It appears that temporal integration in the noctuid ear can be characterised by different time constants. One, termed the intrinsic time constant, is measured in the double-click experiments and provides information about the temporal integration and resolution within the receptor cell. Behavioural time constants, on the other hand, characterise the temporal integration reflected in the behaviour of the animals.}

      \field{abstract}{The vector strength, a number between 0 and 1, is a classical notion in biology. It was first used in neurobiology by Goldberg and Brown (J Neurophys 31:639–{}656, 1969) but dates back at least to von Mises (Phys Z 19:490–{}500, 1918). It is widely used as a means to measure the periodicity or lack of periodicity of a neuronal response to an outside periodic signal. Here, we provide a self-contained and simple treatment of a closely related notion, the synchrony vector, a complex number with the vector strength as its absolute value and with a definite phase that one can directly relate to a biophysical delay. The present analysis is essentially geometrical and based on convexity. As such it does two things. First, it maps a sequence of points, events such as spike times on the time axis, onto the unit circle in the complex plane so that for a perfectly periodic repetition, a single point on the unit circle appears. Second, events hardly ever occur periodically, so that we need a criterion of how to extract periodicity out of a set of real numbers. It is here where convex geometry comes in, and a geometrically intuitive picture results. We also quantify how the events cluster around a period as the vector strength goes to 1. A typical example from the auditory system is used to illustrate the general considerations. Furthermore, von Mises' seminal contribution to the notion of vector strength is explained in detail. Finally, we generalize the synchrony vector to a function of angular frequency, not fixed on the input frequency at hand and indicate its potential as a ``resonating'' vector strength.}

      \field{abstract}{The decrease in detection and discrimination thresholds with increases in signal duration has often been taken to indicate that a process of relatively long-term temporal integration occurs in hearing. Two experiments are reported that suggest that no such process occurs. The first experiment is similar to the two-pulse experiment reported by Zwislocki [J. Zwislocki, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 32, 1046-1059 (1960)] in which the threshold in quiet for a pair of brief pulses is measured as a function of the temporal separation between them. Our data indicate that power integration occurs only for separations less than approximately 5 ms. For separations larger than 5-10 ms, thresholds do not change with separation and the pulses appear to be processed independently. In the second experiment, brief 1-kHz tone pulses separated by 100 ms are presented during gaps in a wideband noise. The threshold for a pair of pulses is lower than that for either pulse presented alone, indicating that some type of "integration" occurs. However, the threshold for the pulse pair is not affected by changes in the level of the noise during the interval between the pulses. These data are inconsistent with the classical view of temporal integration that involves long-term integration. They are consistent with the notion that the input is sampled at a fairly high rate and that these samples or "looks" are stored in memory and can be accessed and processed selectively. This multiple-look model can account for the data from the present experiment and also can account for the data on temporal integration for tones and noise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}

      \field{abstract}{The ability of the noctuid A1 cell acoustic receptor to encode biologically relevant information from bat echolocation calls is examined. Short-duration stimuli (less than approximately 6 ms) reduce the dynamic resolution of the receptor, making intensity, and hence range, estimates of foraging bats unreliable. This low dynamic range is further reduced by inaccurate encoding of stimulus intensity, reducing the real dynamic range of the A1 cell to 1 bit at stimulus durations below 3.1 ms. Interspike interval is also an unreliable measure of stimulus intensity at low stimulus levels and/or for short-duration stimuli. The quantity of information encoded per stimulus is reduced as the presentation rate of stimuli is increased. The spontaneous generation of A1 cell action potentials may reduce the ability of the moth to discriminate bat from non-bat signals. Even with a recognition criterion of three A1 cell spikes per call, the moth would regularly make wrong decisions about a bat being present in the immediate environment. Removing this noise would necessitate a considerable loss of information through filtering at the interneurone level. It is proposed that, for bats using short-duration calls, the moth would only be able to recognise an approaching bat from the repetitious nature of the incoming signal.}

      \field{abstract}{Insects are capable of detecting a broad range of acoustic signals transmitted through air, water, or solids. Auditory sensory organs are morphologically diverse with respect to their body location, accessory structures, and number of sensilla, but remarkably uniform in that most are innervated by chordotonal organs. Chordotonal organs are structurally complex Type I mechanoreceptors that are distributed throughout the insect body and function to detect a wide range of mechanical stimuli, from gross motor movements to air-borne sounds. At present, little is known about how chordotonal organs in general function to convert mechanical stimuli to nerve impulses, and our limited understanding of this process represents one of the major challenges to the study of insect auditory systems today. This report reviews the literature on chordotonal organs innervating insect ears, with the broad intention of uncovering some common structural specializations of peripheral auditory systems, and identifying new avenues for research. A general overview of chordotonal organ ultrastructure is presented, followed by a summary of the current theories on mechanical coupling and transduction in monodynal, mononematic, Type 1 scolopidia, which characteristically innervate insect ears. Auditory organs of different insect taxa are reviewed, focusing primarily on tympanal organs, and with some consideration to Johnston's and subgenual organs. It is widely accepted that insect hearing organs evolved from pre-existing proprioceptive chordotonal organs. In addition to certain non-neural adaptations for hearing, such as tracheal expansion and cuticular thinning, the chordotonal organs themselves may have intrinsic specializations for sound reception and transduction, and these are discussed. In the future, an integrated approach, using traditional anatomical and physiological techniques in combination with new methodologies in immunohistochemistry, genetics, and biophysics, will assist in refining hypotheses on how chordotonal organs function, and, ultimately, lead to new insights into the peripheral mechanisms underlying hearing in insects.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper provides an overview of insect peripheral auditory systems focusing on tympanate ears (pressure detectors) and emphasizing research during the last 15 years. The theme throughout is the evolution of hearing in insects. Ears have appeared independently no fewer than 19 times in the class Insecta and are located on various thoracic and abdominal body segments, on legs, on wings, and on mouth parts. All have fundamentally similar structures—{}a tympanum backed by a tracheal sac and a tympanal chordotonal organ—{}though they vary widely in size, ancillary structures, and number of chordotonal sensilla. Novel ears have recently been discovered in praying mantids, two families of beetles, and two families of flies. The tachinid flies are especially notable because they use a previously unknown mechanism for sound localization. Developmental and comparative studies have identified the evolutionary precursors of the tympanal chordotonal organs in several insects; they are uniformly chordotonal proprioceptors. Tympanate species fall into clusters determined by which of the embryologically defined chordotonal organ groups in each body segment served as precursor for the tympanal organ. This suggests that the many appearances of hearing could arise from changes in a small number of developmental modules. The nature of those developmental changes that lead to a functional insect ear is not yet known. Microsc. Res. Tech. 47:380–{}400, 1999. ௠ 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}
