  abstract = {Temporal integration in the Al acoustic receptor cell of noctuid moths (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was studied. This was done by recording from the auditory nerve of Spodoptera littoralis and Noctua pronuba while stimulating with short-duration tone pulses. Consistent with previous experiments of the same kind, a decrease in threshold was observed with increasing stimulus duration. These threshold improvements, however, were larger than expected from an energy detector model of the receptor based on previous experiments with double clicks. This difference was analysed and could be attributed to a bias introduced by the choice of threshold criterion. If a fixed number of spikes elicited per stimulation is used as criterion, this will tend to lower the measured thresholds for long durations because for long stimuli, more time is available for accumulation of the spikes needed to exceed the criterion. It appears that temporal integration in the noctuid ear can be characterised by different time constants. One, termed the intrinsic time constant, is measured in the double-click experiments and provides information about the temporal integration and resolution within the receptor cell. Behavioural time constants, on the other hand, characterise the temporal integration reflected in the behaviour of the animals.},

  doi = {10.1121/1.1907781 },
  abstract = {This paper deals with some measurements concerning the threshold versus duration for tone pulses. A new hypothesis is introduced: Switching on a tone pulse of intensity I results in an effect s somewhere in the hearing pathway, that approaches its final value asymptotically according to an exponential function; this final value is proportional to I; perception occurs when s exceeds a critical value so. The experiments show that this hypothesis gives a better description than the hypotheses thus far used. The time constant varies from ca 375 msec at 250 cps to ca 150 msec at 8000 cps. For short pulse durations the data deviate from the hypothesis. This deviation can be explained by the assumption that energy integration around each fre- quency is restricted to a fixed band width. A formula is derived which gives a correction to the mentioned relationship for short durations. In this way the band width at the different test frequencies could be deter- mined. The general course of this band width as a function of frequency agrees with the "Kopplungsbreite" after G\"assler.},

  abstract = {The decrease in detection and discrimination thresholds with increases in signal duration has often been taken to indicate that a process of relatively long-term temporal integration occurs in hearing. Two experiments are reported that suggest that no such process occurs. The first experiment is similar to the two-pulse experiment reported by Zwislocki [J. Zwislocki, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 32, 1046-1059 (1960)] in which the threshold in quiet for a pair of brief pulses is measured as a function of the temporal separation between them. Our data indicate that power integration occurs only for separations less than approximately 5 ms. For separations larger than 5-10 ms, thresholds do not change with separation and the pulses appear to be processed independently. In the second experiment, brief 1-kHz tone pulses separated by 100 ms are presented during gaps in a wideband noise. The threshold for a pair of pulses is lower than that for either pulse presented alone, indicating that some type of "integration" occurs. However, the threshold for the pulse pair is not affected by changes in the level of the noise during the interval between the pulses. These data are inconsistent with the classical view of temporal integration that involves long-term integration. They are consistent with the notion that the input is sampled at a fairly high rate and that these samples or "looks" are stored in memory and can be accessed and processed selectively. This multiple-look model can account for the data from the present experiment and also can account for the data on temporal integration for tones and noise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {1. The electric activity of the tympanic organ of Empyreuma pugione was recorded with a stainless steel hook electrode from the tympanic nerve in the mesothorax before it enters the pter-othoracic ganglion. The frequencies of the acoustic stimuli were 16, 20, 24 and 34 kHz; the duration was 45 ms, 200 ms and 5 s and the intensities ranged from 30 to 100 dB (0 dB=2 x 10 -5 N/m2). 2. The tympanic organ of this species has three receptors, two of which have an auditory function (A 1 and A 2 cells), while the third one does not seem to respond to acoustic stimuli (B cell). The A cells differ in the amplitude of their action poten-tials, in their sensitivity to acoustic stimuli and in the velocity of adaptation. With stimulus durations of 45 ms to 1 s, the Al-cell response shows a non-monotonic relation with stimulus intensity, with a maximum at 25-35 dB above its threshold value, and a decrease with higher intensities. With longer acoustic stimuli this relation shows saturation with stimulus intensities 20 dB above threshold. The A2-cell response shows a monotonic relation with stimulus intensity from 45 ms to 1 s, and a non-monotonic one for longer durations. There is a linear relation between the increase of A2-cell re-sponse and the decrease of A\textasciitilde{}-cell response. The temporal pattern of discharge of the auditory re-ceptors in their response to acoustic stimuli show a 'mirror image'. When acoustic stimulus ceases, the A 1 cell shows variations of its spontaneous dis-charge previous to stimulation, which are post-stimulus phenomena that depend in their character and duration on the intensity and duration of the stimulus. 3. These physiological characteristics are com-pared with those described in other lepidopterans. Possible explanations for the observed Al-cell re-Abbreviation: AP action potential sponse decrease are discussed; among them a later-al inhibitory mechanism of the A 2 cell over the A1 receptor is postulated.},

  volume = {199},
  issn = {0022-0949},
  abstract = {The ability of the noctuid A1 cell acoustic receptor to encode biologically relevant information from bat echolocation calls is examined. Short-duration stimuli (less than approximately 6 ms) reduce the dynamic resolution of the receptor, making intensity, and hence range, estimates of foraging bats unreliable. This low dynamic range is further reduced by inaccurate encoding of stimulus intensity, reducing the real dynamic range of the A1 cell to 1 bit at stimulus durations below 3.1 ms. Interspike interval is also an unreliable measure of stimulus intensity at low stimulus levels and/or for short-duration stimuli. The quantity of information encoded per stimulus is reduced as the presentation rate of stimuli is increased. The spontaneous generation of A1 cell action potentials may reduce the ability of the moth to discriminate bat from non-bat signals. Even with a recognition criterion of three A1 cell spikes per call, the moth would regularly make wrong decisions about a bat being present in the immediate environment. Removing this noise would necessitate a considerable loss of information through filtering at the interneurone level. It is proposed that, for bats using short-duration calls, the moth would only be able to recognise an approaching bat from the repetitious nature of the incoming signal.},

  abstract = {Stochastic resonance is demonstrated in a simple energy detector model, as a non-monotonic relationship between signal-to-noise ratio and detection of a sinusoid signal in bandpass-limited Gaussian noise. The behaviour of the model detecting signals of various intensities and signal-to-noise ratios was investigated. Significant improvement in detection was obtained by adding noise for mean signal intensities below the detection criterion of the detector. The range of usable noise levels, however, may be too small to be biologically meaningful. It is demonstrated that improving detection in the analysed model by adding noise to an otherwise undetectable signal is only at best as efficient as what can be obtained by adjusting the criterion to the signal-to-noise ratio. Improving detection by means of stochastic resonance is thus a sub-optimal strategy. It is speculated whether a demonstration of stochastic resonance in a biological system indicates any adaptive significance. More than anything, it indicates the presence of a mismatch between receptor sensitivity and the signal-to-noise ratio of the experiment, not the cause of this mismatch.},

Stochastic resonance (SR) is a nonlinear, statistical dynamics whereby information flow in a multistate system is enhanced by the presence of optimized, random noise1-4. A major consequence of SR for signal reception is that it makes possible substantial improvements in the detection of weak periodic signals. Although SR has recently been demonstrated in several artificial physical systems5,6, it may also occur naturally, and an intriguing possibility is that biological systems have evolved the capability to exploit SR by optimizing endogenous sources of noise. Sensory systems are an obvious place to look for SR, as they excel at detecting weak signals in a noisy environment. Here we demonstrate SR using external noise applied to crayfish mechanoreceptor cells. Our results show that individual neurons can provide a physiological substrate for SR in sensory systems.},

  abstract = {Female greater wax moths Galleria mellonella display by wing fanning in response to bursts of ultrasonic calls produced by males. The temporal and spectral characteristics of these calls show some similarities with the echolocation calls of bats that emit frequency-modulated (FM) signals. Female G. mellonella therefore need to distinguish between the attractive signals of male conspecifics, which may lead to mating opportunities, and similar sounds made by predatory bats. We therefore predicted that (1) females would display in response to playbacks of male calls; (2) females would not display in response to playbacks of the calls of echolocating bats (we used the calls of Daubenton's bat Myotis daubentonii as representative of a typical FM echolocating bat); and (3) when presented with male calls and bat calls during the same time block, females would display more when perceived predation risk was lower. We manipulated predation risk in two ways. First, we varied the intensity of bat calls to represent a nearby (high risk) or distant (low risk) bat. Second, we played back calls of bats searching for prey (low risk) and attacking prey (high risk). All predictions were supported, suggesting that female G. mellonella are able to distinguish conspecific male mating calls from bat calls, and that they modify display rate in relation to predation risk. The mechanism (s) by which the moths separate the calls of bat and moth must involve temporal cues. Bat and moth signals differ considerably in duration, and differences in duration could be encoded by the moth's nervous system and used in discrimination.},

  abstract = {Pair formation in the lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella (Lepidoptera Pyralidae), is accomplished via male-produced pulses (100 $\mu$sec) of ultrasound (100 kHz) attractive to females. A. grisella are sensitive to a wide range of ultrasonic frequencies, enabling them to hear the echolocation signals of both aerial-hawking and substrate-gleaning bats. Both flying and running moths exhibit defensive behaviors, dropping to the ground and cessation of locomotion, respectively, in response to simulated bat echolocations. We determined that female A. grisella discriminate the mating signals of advertising males from bat echolocations on the basis of the faster pulse rates ($>$ 60 sec -1) of mating signals. Terrestrial defensive behavior is elicited by a slow rate of lengthy ($\geq$ 1 msec) pulses, features of most searching phase bat echolocations. Unlike other insects that perceive and evade insectivorous bats, the perception of and negative responses to predators probably preceded acoustic signalling in A. grisella and other acoustic Lepidoptera. Thus, the acoustic signalling system may have originated via exploitation of an ancestral receiver bias, but development of a positive receiver response, and a possible shift in a signal character (pulse rate), must have occurred subsequently. We suggest various processes that may have allowed this evolutionary development and call attention to the potential role that the perception of predators and associated negative responses may have played in the evolution of signalling systems via exploitation of receiver bias.},

The influence of artificially generated, high-intensity, ultrasound signals (25 kHz, 106 dB SPL at 1 m distance) on different parameters involved in the odour-mediated mating behaviour of this species and its potential use in population control was investigated. All moths flying towards olfactory cues in flight tunnel experiments reacted strongly to a 1 s ultrasound pulse by cessation of flight and falling out of the odour plume. The source contact proportion of both male moths orienting towards the female-produced sex pheromone and of mated female moths orienting towards an oviposition cue was reduced by 40\%, compared to unexposed moths. Calling females responded to the sound by retraction of the ovipositor or by falling to the ground. Long-term exposure to repetitive pulses of ultrasound suppressed female calling by up to 27\%. Furthermore, mating in plastic tents was disrupted by up to 58\% in ultrasound-treated tents using different sound regimens, compared to control tents. The results are discussed in relation to the potential use of ultrasound technology for the population control of pyralid stored product pests.},

  abstract = {Greater wax moths (Galleria mellonella L., Pyraloidea) use ultrasound sensitive ears to detect clicking conspecifics and echolocating bats. Pyralid ears have four sensory cells, A(1-4). The audiogram of G. mellonella has best frequency at 60 kHz with a threshold around 47 dB sound pressure level. A(1) and A(2) have almost equal thresholds in contrast to noctuids and geometrids. A(3) responds at + 12 to + 16 dB relative to the A(1) threshold. The threshold data from the A-cells give no indication of frequency discrimination in greater wax moths. Tethered greater wax moths respond to ultrasound with short-latency cessation of flight at + 20 to + 25 dB relative to the A(1) threshold. The behavioural threshold curve parallels the audiogram, thus further corroborating the lack of frequency discrimination. Hence, the distinction between bats and conspecifics is probably based on temporal cues. At a constant duty cycle (percentage of time where sound is on) the pulse repetition rate has no effect on the threshold for flight cessation, but stimulus duration affects both sensory and behavioural thresholds. The maximum integration time is essentially the same: 45 ms for the A(1)-cell and 50-60 ms for the flight cessation response. However, the slopes of the time-intensity trade-off functions are very different: - 2.1 dB per doubling of sound duration for the A(1)-cell threshold, and - 7.2 dB per doubling of sound duration for the behavioural threshold. The significance of the results for sexual acoustic communication as well as for bat defence is discussed.},

We illustrate the CI and SACs by comparing temporal coding in the auditory nerve and output fibers of the cochlear nucleus. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Variable behavioral responses to identical visual stimuli can, in part, be traced back to variable neuronal signals that provide unreliable information about the outside world. This unreliability in encoding of visual information is caused by several noise sources such as photon noise, synaptic noise, or the stochastic nature of ion channels. Neurons of the fly's visual motion pathway have been claimed to represent perfect encoders, with photon noise as the main noise source limiting their performance. Other studies on the fly's visual system suggest, however, that internal noise emerging within the nervous system also affects the reliability of motion vision. To resolve these contradictory interpretations, we performed an electrophysiological investigation, inspired by the "equivalent noise" paradigm applied in psychophysics, on the fly's motion-sensitive H1 neuron. Noise-like brightness fluctuations of different strength were superimposed on the motion stimuli. Because the noise level found to affect the temporal properties of the spike responses is much larger than the estimate of photon noise under the experimental conditions, our results indicate that motion vision is more likely to be limited by internal sources of variability than by photon noise.},

We suggest that in many cases in biology, the causal link might be bi-directional: A causes B through a fast-acting physiological process, while B causes A through a slowly accumulating evolutionary process. Furthermore, many trained biologists tend to consistently focus at first on the fast-acting direction, and overlook the slower process in the opposite direction. We analyse several examples from modern biology that demonstrate this bias (codon usage optimality and gene expression, gene duplication and genetic dispensability, stem cell division and cancer risk, and the microbiome and host metabolism) and also discuss an example from linguistics. These examples demonstrate mutual effects between the fast physiological processes and the slow evolutionary ones. We believe that building awareness of inference biases among biologists who tend to prefer one causal direction over another could improve scientific reasoning.},

  abstract = {1. Certain species of tiger moths emit clicks when stimulated by bat-like sounds. These clicks are generated by modified thoracic episterna (tymbals) (Fig. 1) and constitute a rhythmic behaviour activated by simple sensory input. 2. Tymbal periods are indirectly related to stimulus intensity and periods (Fig. 3). Moths initiate sounds with the tymbal opposite to the stimulated ear and once a sequence commences it continues in an undisrupted fashion. 3. The tymbal is innervated by a pleural branch (IIIN2a) of the metathoracic leg nerve, a similar anatomy to that in the unmodified episterna of silent moths (Fig. 5). Backfills of the IIIN2a in Cycnia tenera reveal sensory fibres and a cluster of 5-9 motor neurons with densely overlying dendritic fields (Fig. 6). 4. Extracellular recordings of the IIIN2a reveal a large impulse preceding each tymbal sound (Fig. 7). I suggest that this impulse results from the synchronous firing of 2-3 motor neurons and is the motor output of the tymbal central pattern generator (CPG). The spikes alternate (Figs. 9, 10) and are bilaterally co-related (Fig. 11) but with an phase asymmetry of 2-3 ms (Fig. 12). 5. Normal motor output continues in the absence of tymbal sounds (Fig. 13) and when all nerve-tymbal connections are severed (Fig. 14, Table 1) therefore this CPG operates independent of sensory feedback. A model is proposed for the tymbal circuitry based upon the present data and the auditory organization of related noctuid moths (Fig. 15). I propose that the tymbal response in modern arctiids evolved from either flight or walking CPGs and that preadaptive circuitry ancestral to tymbal movements still exists in modern silent Lepidoptera.},

Despite the importance of 3D spatial localization to parse objects in the environment and to guide movement, most neurophysiological investigations of sensory mapping have been limited to studies of restrained subjects, tested with 2D, artificial stimuli. Here, we show for the first time that sensory neurons in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) of the free-flying echolocating bat encode 3D egocentric space, and that the bat's inspection of objects in the physical environment sharpens tuning of single neurons, and shifts peak responses to represent closer distances. These findings emerged from wireless neural recordings in free-flying bats, in combination with an echo model that computes the animal's instantaneous stimulus space. Our research reveals dynamic 3D space coding in a freely moving mammal engaged in a real-world navigation task.},

  volume = {287},
  doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.05.028},
  abstract = {Background Measures of spike train synchrony are widely used in both experimental and computational neuroscience. Time-scale independent and parameter-free measures, such as the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance and SPIKE-synchronization, are preferable to time scale parametric measures, since by adapting to the local firing rate they take into account all the time scales of a given dataset. New method In data containing multiple time scales (e.g. regular spiking and bursts) one is typically less interested in the smallest time scales and a more adaptive approach is needed. Here we propose the A-ISI-distance, the A-SPIKE-distance and A-SPIKE-synchronization, which generalize the original measures by considering the local relative to the global time scales. For the A-SPIKE-distance we also introduce a rate-independent extension called the RIA-SPIKE-distance, which focuses specifically on spike timing. Results The adaptive generalizations A-ISI-distance and A-SPIKE-distance allow to disregard spike time differences that are not relevant on a more global scale. A-SPIKE-synchronization does not any longer demand an unreasonably high accuracy for spike doublets and coinciding bursts. Finally, the RIA-SPIKE-distance proves to be independent of rate ratios between spike trains. Comparison with existing methods We find that compared to the original versions the A-ISI-distance and the A-SPIKE-distance yield improvements for spike trains containing different time scales without exhibiting any unwanted side effects in other examples. A-SPIKE-synchronization matches spikes more efficiently than SPIKE-synchronization. Conclusions With these proposals we have completed the picture, since we now provide adaptive generalized measures that are sensitive to firing rate only (A-ISI-distance), to timing only (ARI-SPIKE-distance), and to both at the same time (A-SPIKE-distance).},

We used novel acoustic tomography to convert echoes into visual representations and compare these cues to traditional echo measurements. We provide a new hypothesis for the echo-acoustic basis of prey detection on surfaces. We propose that bats perceive a change in depth profile and an 'acoustic shadow' cast by prey. The shadow is more salient than prey echoes and particularly strong on smooth surfaces. This may explain why bats look for prey on flat surfaces like leaves using scanning behaviour. We propose that rather than forming search images for prey, whose characteristics are unpredictable, predators may look for disruptions to the resting surface (acoustic shadows). The fact that the acoustic shadow is much fainter on rougher resting surfaces provides the first empirical evidence for 'acoustic camouflage' as an anti-predator defence mechanism.},

As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses (p$\delta$ = 1), or with alternative hypotheses (p$\delta$ = 0), or when the data are inconclusive (0 $<$ p$\delta$ $<$ 1). Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with alternative or null hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Despite their simple auditory systems, some insect species recognize certain temporal aspects of acoustic stimuli with an acuity equal to that of vertebrates; however, the underlying neural mechanisms and coding schemes are only partially un-derstood. In this study, we analyze the response characteristics of the peripheral auditory system of grasshoppers with special emphasis on the representation of species-specific communi-cation signals. We use both natural calling songs and artificial random stimuli designed to focus on two low-order statistical properties of the songs: their typical time scales and the distri-bution of their modulation amplitudes. Based on stimulus reconstruction techniques and quantified within an information-theoretic framework, our data show that artificial stimuli with typical time scales of Ͼ40 msec can be read from single spike trains with high accuracy. Faster stimulus variations can be reconstructed only for behaviorally relevant amplitude distributions. The highest rates of information trans-mission (180 bits/sec) and the highest coding efficiencies (40\%) are obtained for stimuli that capture both the time scales and amplitude distributions of natural songs. Use of multiple spike trains significantly improves the recon-struction of stimuli that vary on time scales Ͻ40 msec or feature amplitude distributions as occur when several grasshopper songs overlap. Signal-to-noise ratios obtained from the recon-structions of natural songs do not exceed those obtained from artificial stimuli with the same low-order statistical properties. We conclude that auditory receptor neurons are optimized to extract both the time scales and the amplitude distribution of natural songs. They are not optimized, however, to extract higher-order statistical properties of the song-specific rhythmic patterns.},

The advent of modern experimental techniques like two-photon population calcium imaging makes it possible to monitor the spiking activity of multiple neurons as they are participating in specific cognitive tasks. The development of appropriate theoretical tools to quantify and interpret the spiking activity of multiple neurons, however, is still in its infancy. One of the simplest and widely used measures of correlated activity is the pairwise correlation coefficient. While spike correlation coefficients are easy to compute using the available numerical toolboxes, it has remained largely an open question whether they are indeed a reliable measure of synchrony. Surprisingly, despite the intense use of correlation coefficients in the design of synthetic spike trains, the construction of population models and the assessment of the synchrony level in live neuronal networks very little was known about their computational properties. We showed that many features of pairwise spike correlations can be studied analytically in a tractable threshold model. Importantly, we demonstrated that under some circumstances the correlation coefficients can vanish, even though input and also pairwise spike cross correlations are present. This finding suggests that the most popular and frequently used measures can, by design, fail to capture the neuronal synchrony.},

Despite the rapid development of specialized methods for directional statistics over the last fifty years, there is only little software available that makes such methods easy to use for practioners. Most importantly, one of the most commonly used programming languages in biosciences, MATLAB, is currently not supporting directional statistics. To remedy this situation, we have implemented the CircStat toolbox for MATLAB which provides methods for the descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of directional data. We cover the statistical background of the available methods and describe how to apply them to data. Finally, we analyze a dataset from neurophysiology to demonstrate the capabilities of the CircStat toolbox.},

  abstract = {Quite often a response to some input with a specific frequency $\nu$($\bigcirc$) can be described through a sequence of discrete events. Here, we study the synchrony vector, whose length stands for the vector strength, and in doing so focus on neuronal response in terms of spike times. The latter are supposed to be given by experiment. Instead of singling out the stimulus frequency $\nu$($\bigcirc$) we study the synchrony vector as a function of the real frequency variable $\nu$. Its length turns out to be a resonating vector strength in that it shows clear maxima in the neighborhood of $\nu$($\bigcirc$) and multiples thereof, hence, allowing an easy way of determining response frequencies. We study this "resonating" vector strength for two concrete but rather different cases, viz., a specific midbrain neuron in the auditory system of cat and a primary detector neuron belonging to the electric sense of the wave-type electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. We show that the resonating vector strength always performs a clear resonance correlated with the phase locking that it quantifies. We analyze the influence of noise and demonstrate how well the resonance associated with maximal vector strength indicates the dominant stimulus frequency. Furthermore, we exhibit how one can obtain a specific phase associated with, for instance, a delay in auditory analysis.},

Since basic properties of nerve cells, e.g., the time constants of ion channels, strongly depend on temperature, a temperature shift likely affects the processing of the temporal structure of sensory stimuli. This can be critical in acoustic communication systems in which time patterns of signals are decisive for recognition by the receiver. We investigated the temperature dependence of the responses of locust auditory receptors and interneurons by varying the temperature of the experimental animals during intracellular recordings. The resolution of fast amplitude modulations of acoustic signals was determined in a gap detection paradigm. In auditory receptors and local (second order) interneurons, temporal resolution was improved at higher temperatures. This gain could be attributed to a higher precision of spike timing. In a third-order neuron, a rise in temperature affected the interactions of inhibition and excitation in a complex manner, also resulting in a better resolution of gaps in the millisecond range.},

A common measure of auditory temporal acuity in humans is the threshold for detection of brief gaps in noise. Gap-detection deficits, observed in developmen-tal disorders, are considered evidence for " sluggish " auditory processing. Here we show, in a mouse model of gap-detection deficits, that auditory brain sensitivity to brief gaps in noise can be impaired even without a general loss of central auditory temporal acuity. Extra-cellular recordings in three different subdivisions of the auditory thalamus in anesthetized mice revealed a stimulus-specific, subdivision-specific deficit in thalamic sensitivity to brief gaps in noise in experimental animals relative to controls. Neural responses to brief gaps in noise were reduced, but responses to other rapidly changing stimuli unaffected, in lemniscal and nonlemniscal (but not polysensory) subdivisions of the medial geniculate body. Through experiments and modeling, we demonstrate that the observed deficits in thalamic sensitivity to brief gaps in noise arise from reduced neural population activity following noise offsets, but not onsets. These results reveal dissociable sound-onset-sensitive and sound-offset-sensitive channels underlying auditory temporal processing, and suggest that gap-detection deficits can arise from specific impairment of the sound-offset-sensitive channel.},

It was first used in neurobiology by Goldberg and Brown (J Neurophys 31:639\textendash{}656, 1969) but dates back at least to von Mises (Phys Z 19:490\textendash{}500, 1918). It is widely used as a means to measure the periodicity or lack of periodicity of a neuronal response to an outside periodic signal. Here, we provide a self-contained and simple treatment of a closely related notion, the synchrony vector, a complex number with the vector strength as its absolute value and with a definite phase that one can directly relate to a biophysical delay. The present analysis is essentially geometrical and based on convexity. As such it does two things. First, it maps a sequence of points, events such as spike times on the time axis, onto the unit circle in the complex plane so that for a perfectly periodic repetition, a single point on the unit circle appears. Second, events hardly ever occur periodically, so that we need a criterion of how to extract periodicity out of a set of real numbers. It is here where convex geometry comes in, and a geometrically intuitive picture results. We also quantify how the events cluster around a period as the vector strength goes to 1. A typical example from the auditory system is used to illustrate the general considerations. Furthermore, von Mises' seminal contribution to the notion of vector strength is explained in detail. Finally, we generalize the synchrony vector to a function of angular frequency, not fixed on the input frequency at hand and indicate its potential as a ``resonating'' vector strength.},

  doi = {10.1101/037648},
  abstract = {The auditory stimulation method used in experiments on moth A cell(s) is generally believed to be adequate to characterise the encoding of echolocation signals. The stimulation method hosts, though, several bias. Their compounded effects can explain a range of discrepancies between the reported electrophysiological recordings and significantly alter the current interpretation. To test the hypothesis that the bias may significantly alter our current understanding of the moth's auditory transducer characteristics, papers using the same auditory stimulation method and reporting on either spiking threshold or spiking activity of the moth's A cells were analysed. The consistency of the reported data was assessed. A range of corrections issued from best practices and theoretical background were applied to the data in an attempt to re-interpret the data. We found that it is not possible to apply a posteriori corrections to all data and bias. However the corrected data indicates that the A cell's spiking may be (i) independent of the repetition rate, (ii) maximum when detecting the long and low intensity pulses of the bat in searching mode, and (iii) steadily reduce as the bat closes on the moth. These observations raise the possibility that a fixed action pattern drives the moths's erratic evasive manoeuvres until the final moment. In depth investigation of the potential bias also suggest that the auditory transducer's response may be constant for a larger frequency range than thought so far, and provide clues to explain the negative taxis in response to the searching bats's calls detection.},

  abstract = {Animals co-occur with multiple predators, making sensory systems that can encode information about diverse predators advantageous. Moths in the families Noctuidae and Erebidae have ears with two auditory receptor cells (A1 and A2) used to detect the echolocation calls of predatory bats. Bat communities contain species that vary in echolocation call duration, and the dynamic range of A1 is limited by the duration of sound, suggesting that A1 provides less information about bats with shorter echolocation calls. To test this hypothesis, we obtained intensity\textendash{}response functions for both receptor cells across many moth species for sound pulse durations representing the range of echolocation call durations produced by bat species in northeastern North America. We found that the threshold and dynamic range of both cells varied with sound pulse duration. The number of A1 action potentials per sound pulse increases linearly with increasing amplitude for long-duration pulses, saturating near the A2 threshold. For short sound pulses, however, A1 saturates with only a few action potentials per pulse at amplitudes far lower than the A2 threshold for both single sound pulses and pulse sequences typical of searching or approaching bats. Neural adaptation was only evident in response to approaching bat sequences at high amplitudes, not search-phase sequences. These results show that, for short echolocation calls, a large range of sound levels cannot be coded by moth auditory receptor activity, resulting in no information about the distance of a bat, although differences in activity between ears might provide information about direction.},

  doi = {10.1111/1365-2435.13073},
  abstract = {Ears evolved independently in many insect taxa due to the selection pressure of echolocating bats. Eared moths perform evasive flight manoeuvres upon hearing approaching bats, thereby substantially increasing survival probability. Accordingly, eared moths constitute only a minor portion of many bats' diets. In contrast, the barbastelle bat Barbastella barbastellus almost exclusively feeds on eared moths by emitting low-amplitude stealth echolocation calls that are undetectable by distant moths. While closing in on the prey, however, the calls might become audible. We thus hypothesised that barbastelle bats lower the source level of their calls even further while closing in, such that the level at the moth's ear remains below the moth's hearing threshold and the moth fails to elicit its evasive manoeuvre.

We tested these hypotheses by offering tethered moths to barbastelle bats in the wild and in captivity. We reconstructed the bats' three-dimensional flight paths based on time-of-arrival differences of the echolocation calls at four microphones, measured the received sound levels at the moth's position with an additional miniature microphone, and calculated call source levels.

We show that barbastelle bats continuously reduced source level upon detecting a moth, thereby delaying the time and shortening the distance when the moth might detect the bat. The received level at the targeted moth never exceeded the moth's neuronal hearing threshold by more than 10~dB, which is likely sufficiently low to prevent moth evasive flight.

Barbastelle bats emit low-amplitude calls to counter moth hearing. Continued amplitude reduction during an attack extends the time before the prey becomes aware of the predator, if at all. In combination, these two strategies allowed barbastelle bats to access a food resource which is largely unavailable to competing species, thereby probably altering competition between sympatric predators.

  abstract = {Time scale parametric spike train distances like the Victor and the van Rossum distances are often applied to study the neural code based on neural stimuli discrimination. Different neural coding hypotheses, such as rate or coincidence coding, can be assessed by combining a time scale parametric spike train distance with a classifier in order to obtain the optimal discrimination performance. The time scale for which the responses to different stimuli are distinguished best is assumed to be the discriminative precision of the neural code. The relevance of temporal coding is evaluated by comparing the optimal discrimination performance with the one achieved when assuming a rate code.We here characterize the measures quantifying the discrimination performance, the discriminative precision, and the relevance of temporal coding. Furthermore, we evaluate the information these quantities provide about the neural code. We show that the discriminative precision is too unspecific to be interpreted in terms of the time scales relevant for encoding. Accordingly, the time scale parametric nature of the distances is mainly an advantage because it allows maximizing the discrimination performance across a whole set of measures with different sensitivities determined by the time scale parameter, but not due to the possibility to examine the temporal properties of the neural code. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Sensory systems must translate incoming signals quickly and reliably so that an animal can act successfully in its environment. Even at the level of receptor neurons, however, functional aspects of the sensory encoding process are not yet fully understood. Specifically, this concerns the question how stimulus features and neural response characteristics lead to an efficient transmission of sensory information. To address this issue, we have recorded and analyzed spike trains from grasshopper auditory receptors, while systematically varying the stimulus statistics. The stimulus variations profoundly influenced the efficiency of neural encoding. This influence was largely attributable to the presence of specific stimulus features that triggered remarkably precise spikes whose trial-to-trial timing variability was as low as 0.15 ms--one order of magnitude shorter than typical stimulus time scales. Precise spikes decreased the noise entropy of the spike trains, thereby increasing the rate of information transmission. In contrast, the total spike train entropy, which quantifies the variety of different spike train patterns, hardly changed when stimulus conditions were altered, as long as the neural firing rate remained the same. This finding shows that stimulus distributions that were transmitted with high information rates did not invoke additional response patterns, but instead displayed exceptional temporal precision in their neural representation. The acoustic stimuli that led to the highest information rates and smallest spike-time jitter feature pronounced sound-pressure deflections lasting for 2-3 ms. These upstrokes are reminiscent of salient structures found in natural grasshopper communication signals, suggesting that precise spikes selectively encode particularly important aspects of the natural stimulus environment.},

  abstract = {Sparse coding schemes are employed by many sensory systems and implement efficient coding principles. Yet, the computations yielding sparse representations are often only partly understood. The early auditory system of the grasshopper produces a temporally and population-sparse representation of natural communication signals. To reveal the computations generating such a code, we estimated 1D and 2D linear-nonlinear models. We then used these models to examine the contribution of different model components to response sparseness. 2D models were better able to reproduce the sparseness measured in the system: while 1D models only captured 55\% of the population sparseness at the network's output, 2D models accounted for 88\% of it. Looking at the model structure, we could identify two types of computation, which increase sparseness. First, a sensitivity to the derivative of the stimulus and, second, the combination of a fast, excitatory and a slow, suppressive feature. Both were implemented in different classes of cells and increased the specificity and diversity of responses. The two types produced more transient responses and thereby amplified temporal sparseness. Additionally, the second type of computation contributed to population sparseness by increasing the diversity of feature selectivity through a wide range of delays between an excitatory and a suppressive feature. Both kinds of computation can be implemented through spike-frequency adaptation or slow inhibition-mechanisms found in many systems. Our results from the auditory system of the grasshopper are thus likely to reflect general principles underlying the emergence of sparse representations.},

Behavioral experiments suggested that separate pathways exist for song recognition and sound localization. As for the neurophys-iological basis, auditory receptors respond tonically and necessarily carry all information explaining behavioral performances in their spiking responses. However, for pattern recognition as well as for coding of direc-tional information, it seems necessary for the animal to evaluate a whole set of parallel receptor fibres to achieve the precision observed in behavior. The information of receptors converges onto thoracic neurons which drive neurons ascending to the brain. Some of these ascending neurons exhibit dramatic response differences either for various temporal patterns or for sound from different directions and therefore may represent pathways specialized for song recognition or for sound localization.},

This raises the question of whether they can also solve a far more complicated task that might provide a basis for mate preference and sexual selection: to distinguish individual songs by detecting slight vari-ations around the common species-specific theme. Using spike-train discriminability to quantify the precision of neural responses from the auditory periphery of a model grasshopper species, we show that information sufficient to distinguish songs is readily available at the single-cell level when the spike trains are analyzed on a millisecond time scale. To investigate whether information about variations between conspecific songs is available for discrimination, we made electrophysiological recordings in Chorthippus biguttulus females and recorded spike trains from single auditory receptors in response to songs from different conspecific males (Fig. 1a and b). To eliminate simple discrimination cues such as vari-ations in syllable length, we also recorded responses to songs that were rescaled to have a common syllable duration and car-rier spectrum. To obtain these song variants, the original ampli-tude modulations were calculated using the Hilbert transform 3 , rescaled in time, and then combined with the spectrum of one of the songs (Fig. 1c). The resulting mean firing rates are indis-tinguishable (Fig. 1d). Successful discrimination would demand that spike trains elicit-ed by repeated presentations of the same song be more similar to each other than spike trains elicited by different songs (Fig. 1d). To compute the similarity between two spike trains, each spike was replaced by a function f(t) that mimics the time course of an exci-tatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in a hypothetical downstream neuron of the grasshopper's auditory system (Fig. 1e). A distance between the two spike trains was then defined as the mean square distance between their EPSP-convolved traces 4 . By varying the width ($\tau$) of the EPSP function, effects of the temporal resolution can be studied: if $\tau$ is large, only differences in the average spike rate contribute to the distance measure; if $\tau$ is small, even small differences in spike timing matter. We analyzed responses to songs from eight Ch. biguttulus males. For each song, one spike train was arbitrarily chosen as a template. The remaining spike trains were classified by assigning each one to the closest of the eight templates. Averages were then computed by permuting all possible template choices, yielding classification matri-ces (Fig. 2a). The diagonal elements of the matrices correspond to correctly classified spike trains, and the off-diagonal elements to misclassified spike trains. When insisting on a very high time reso-lution ($\tau$ $\leq$ 1 ms) or when largely neglecting temporal informa-tion ($\tau$ $\geq$ 100 ms), the songs cannot be discriminated well, as brief communications nature neuroscience \textbullet{} volume 6 no 4 \textbullet{} april 2003 341 Fig. 1. Acoustic communication signals, artificial songs and sample responses. (a) Grasshoppers produce species-specific sound patterns by rasping their hindlegs across their forewings. Shown are songs generated by one Chorthippus mollis and two Chorthippus biguttulus males. Each song consists of many repetitions of a basic pattern, termed 'syllable'. Scale bar, 500 ms. (b) Within each syllable, the amplitude of the high-frequency broadband carrier is strongly modulated in time as illustrated by the two spectrograms. (c) Equalizing the song spectra and rescaling the length of each syllable to 100 ms yields artificial songs that differ only in their ampli-tude modulation. (d) Spike raster plots of responses from a single audi-tory receptor to five presentations of the two songs shown in (c). (e) The EPSP function f(t) = t * exp(\textendash$\alpha$t) used to compute spike-train distances. The full width at half maximum, $\tau$, is $\tau$ $\approx$ 2.45/$\alpha$. Details of the experimental protocols, which complied with German law governing animal care, are described elsewhere 5 . Stimulus intensities were 50\textendash{}70 dB SPL, yielding spike rates between 100 and 200 Hz; temperature during the measure-ment was 33\textendash{}35 $^\circ$C. Responses to at least six repetitions of the rescaled songs were recorded from n = 18 receptors; for three of these neurons, responses to the original songs were also obtained. a b c d e 342 nature neuroscience \textbullet{} volume 6 no 4 \textbullet{} april 2003 indicated by the many off-diagonal entries in the corresponding matrices. For $\tau$ $\approx$ 5 ms, however, most spike trains are correctly assigned, suggesting that this time scale corresponds to unique song features that auditory receptors accurately encode. Signal variations on a scale of a few milliseconds are thus well suited for song eval-uation; downstream neurons with much longer EPSPs will hardly be able to process the information relevant for discrimination. To investigate how the discrimination ability unfolds in time, we computed how many spike trains are correctly classified as a function of both the spike-train length T and EPSP width $\tau$ (con-tour plot in Fig. 2b). Already at T = 400 ms, after just a few syl-lables or roughly 50 action potentials, the songs are correctly recognized in over 80\% of all trials. Differences in the songs' amplitude modulations, syllable length and carrier spectrum all contribute to this surprisingly rapid and accurate discrimination. Notably, variations in spectral composition often lead to different firing rates, thereby facilitating discrimination. Successful discrimination of the rescaled songs with equal-ized carrier spectrum and uniform syllable length, however, must be based solely on differences in the detailed structure of amplitude modulations within a syllable. Nevertheless, the neural performance does not decrease substantially (Fig. 2c and d). For small T or very small $\tau$, discrimination may even slightly improve as the adjusted spectra lead to higher firing rates and lower trial-to-trial spike time variability for some of the songs. Together, our results show that auditory receptor neurons react to rapid amplitude modulations with high tem-poral accuracy, so even slight differences among stimuli can be recovered. This finding coincides with the observation that quickly varying stimuli lead to greater precision in receptor spike timing than slowly varying stimuli 5 , just as neocortical neurons respond more precisely to fluctuating current injec-tions than to constant currents 6 . Our data indicate that short segments of single spike trains from one auditory receptor suffice to rapidly discriminate the songs of conspecific grasshoppers, provided that a time reso-lution of a few milliseconds is maintained. With 40\textendash{}50 recep-tors per ear, even more information is available for spike-time based computations by downstream neurons. That the female grasshopper's auditory system could, in principle, distinguish individual male songs does not prove, however, that female grasshoppers use this capability. But if near-perfect discrimi-nation is possible, then so is the easier task of preferring cer-tain male songs over others, which female grasshoppers do 7 . The precise role of song discriminability in sexual selection remains an open question for further investigation.},

The modulus-metric does not depend on any parameters and can be com-puted using a fast algorithm whose time depends linearly on the number of spikes in the two spike trains.

At rates both above and below this optimum moths exhibit higher thresholds and reduced responsiveness. These data suggest that C. tenera is capable of using the repetition rate emitted by an approaching bat as a cue in determining the relative proximity of the bat.

  abstract = {ABsTRAcr In a growing class of neurophysiological experiments, the train of impulses ("spikes") produced by a nerve cell is subjected to statistical treatment involving the time intervals between spikes. The statistical techniques available for the analysis of single spike trains are described and related to the underlying mathe-matical theory, that of stochastic point processes, i.e., of stochastic processes whose realizations may be described as series of point events occurring in time, separated by random intervals. For single stationary spike trains, several orders of complexity of statistical treatment are described; the major distinction is that between statistical measures that depend in an essential way on the serial order of interspike intervals and those that are order-independent. The interrelations among the several types of calculations are shown, and an attempt is made to ameliorate the current nomen-clatural confusion in this field. Applications, interpretations, and potential difficul-ties of the statistical techniques are discussed, with special reference to types of spike trains encountered experimentally. Next, the related types of analysis are described for experiments which involve repeated presentations of a brief, isolated stimulus. Finally, the effects of nonstationarity, e.g. long-term changes in firing rate, on the various statistical measures are discussed. Several commonly observed patterns of spike activity are shown to be differentially sensitive to such changes. A companion paper covers the analysis of simultaneously observed spike trains.},

  abstract = {To study the electrophysiological properties of neuronal networks, in vitro studies based on microelectrode arrays have become a viable tool for analysis. Although in constant progress, a challenging task still remains in this area: the development of an efficient spike sorting algorithm that allows an accurate signal analysis at the single-cell level. Most sorting algorithms currently available only extract a specific feature type, such as the principal components or Wavelet coefficients of the measured spike signals in order to separate different spike shapes generated by different neurons. However, due to the great variety in the obtained spike shapes, the derivation of an optimal feature set is still a very complex issue that current algorithms struggle with. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm that (i) extracts a variety of geometric, Wavelet and principal component-based features and (ii) automatically derives a feature subset, most suitable for sorting an individual set of spike signals. Thus, there is a new approach that evaluates the probability distribution of the obtained spike features and consequently determines the candidates most suitable for the actual spike sorting. These candidates can be formed into an individually adjusted set of spike features, allowing a separation of the various shapes present in the obtained neuronal signal by a subsequent expectation maximisation clustering algorithm. Test results with simulated data files and data obtained from chick embryonic neurons cultured on microelectrode arrays showed an excellent classification result, indicating the superior performance of the described algorithm approach.},

  abstract = {The van Rossum metric measures the distance between two spike trains. Measuring a single van Rossum distance between one pair of spike trains is not a computationally expensive task, however, many applications require a matrix of distances between all the spike trains in a set or the calculation of a multi-neuron distance between two populations of spike trains. Moreover, often these calculations need to be repeated for many different parameter values. An algorithm is presented here to render these calculation less computationally expen-sive, making the complexity linear in the number of spikes rather than quadratic.},

  abstract = {The intimate details regarding the coevolution of bats and moths have been elucidated over the past 50 years. The bat-moth story began with the evolution of bat sonar, an exquisite ultrasonic system for tracking prey through the night sky. Moths countered with ears tuned to the high frequencies of bat echolocation and with evasive action through directed turns, loops, spirals, drops, and power dives. Some bat species responded by moving the frequency and intensity of their echolocation cries away from the peak sensitivity of moth ears, and the arms race was on. Tiger moths countered by producing anti-bat sounds. Do the sounds advertise moth toxicity, similar to the bright coloration of butterflies; do they startle the bat, giving the moth a momentary advantage in their aerobatic battle; or do they jam the sonar of the bat? The answer is yes. They do all and more in different situations and in different species. Any insect that flies at night must deal with bat predation. Beetles, mantids, true crickets, m...},

  volume = {198},
  issn = {0022-0949},
  doi = {10.1242/JEB.036921},
  abstract = {1. The tymbal of Cyclochila australasiae consists of a biconvex membrane bearing alternating long and short ribs anteriorly and an irregularly shaped tymbal plate posteriorly. These sclerotised regions are coupled together by the surrounding highly flexible cuticle, which contains resilin. Dorsally, there is a thick pad of resilin, which functions as a spring, returning the tymbal to the out position and maintaining the stress on the long ribs. 2. Contraction of the tymbal muscle causes the tymbal plate to swing inwards, acting as a lever so that the surface of the tymbal moves through more than twice the distance of muscle shortening. This produces an inward movement and twisting of the dorsal ends of the long ribs, which then buckle in sequence, with each rib undergoing a sudden deformation from a convex to a V-shaped profile. Buckling takes place at the rib's weakest point, which is the narrow, highly sclerotised mid-region. 3. Inward buckling of the tymbal generates a loud click with a dominant frequency around 4 kHz. Resonances close to 4 kHz can be demonstrated in a buckled-in tymbal when driven by internal sound or by vibration at the tymbal plate. These resonances occur in sealed cicadas and those in which the abdominal air sac has been opened at both its anterior and posterior ends, which shows that the resonances are not due to the air sac; the tymbal itself is a resonant system. The maximum amplitude of tymbal vibration occurs at the V-shaped dimples in the centre of the long ribs. 4. When the tymbal plus abdominal air sac system is driven by vibration at the tymbal plate, the Q3dB of the sound radiated through the tympana is about 12.5, which is approximately the sum of those of the tymbal (Q=9.3) and of the air sac (Q=3.4) resonators. When the tymbal is not loaded by the air sac, i.e. in the sealed cicada and open cicada preparations, the Q3dB of its resonance is higher, between 13 and 20. 5. The click produced as the tymbal pops out is over 20 dB quieter than the in-click and has a dominant frequency around 6 kHz. When driven in the resting position, resonances are found close to 6 kHz but there is only a weak general vibration of the ribs and tymbal plate. When the tymbal is pushed in gradually, the resonant frequency changes from about 5.5 kHz to about 4.3 kHz as the tymbal buckles inwards. The left and right tymbals of the same insect may differ slightly in their acoustic properties. 6. As the tymbal buckles inwards, it displaces a volume of approximately 6 $\mathrm{\mu}$l into the abdominal air sac volume of about 2 ml. The resulting sound pressure inside the air sac attains peak values of 155$\-$159 dB SPL; the root mean square values are 141$\-$144 dB SPL. The mean peak value just outside the tympana is 148.5 dB SPL. 7. Overall, the present work supports and extends our earlier model of cicada sound production: the tymbal click provides a coherent resonant source that drives the abdominal resonator, from which sound is radiated via the tympana. At the same time, the system provides the pressure transformation between muscle power and sound power that is desirable for efficient sound radiation.},

Seven of 14 sound-producing species tested emitted their sounds in response to the hunting cries of insectivorous bats or simulations thereof. The sounds were generated by the buckling action of the microtymbal band (=strained band) on the surface of the modified thoracic metepisternum (=tymbal). Sound production is not dependent on the presence of microtymbals as four species of Callarctia possessed nonstriated, functional tymbals. In contrast, other species possessed striated, apparently nonfunctional tymbals. The sounds of the arctiids we studied were predominantly ultrasonic ($>$20 kHz) and relatively faint ($<$85 dB at 2 cm) compared with other insect sounds. The acoustic parameters of the arctiids surveyed revealed extremely high levels of variability in the sound. Smaller species generally emit higher pulse repetition rates and more intense signals than larger ones. The behavioural contexts in which the sounds are produced and their relation to arctiid defense are discussed.},

Microscanning laser vibrometry was used to examine the surface vibrations of the entire tympanal region of the ears of the noctuid moths Agrotis exclamationis, Noctua pronuba, Xestia c-nigrum and Xestia triangulum. During stimulation with ultrasound at intensities known to activate receptor neurones, the tympanum vibrates with maximum deflection amplitudes at the location where the receptor cells attach. In the reportedly heterogeneous tympana of noctuid moths, this attachment site is an opaque zone that is surrounded by a transparent, thinner cuticular region. In response to sound pressure, this region moves relatively little compared with the opaque zone. Thus, the deflections of the moth tympanic membrane are not those of a simple circular drum. The acoustic sensitivity of the ear of N. pronuba, as measured on the attachment site, is 100+/-14 nm Pa(-1) (N=10), corresponding to tympanal motion of a mere 200 pm at sound pressure levels near the neural threshold.},

  volume = {209},
  doi = {10.1242/jeb.02295},
  abstract = {Many night-flying insects perform complex, aerobatic escape maneuvers when echolocating bats initiate attack. Tiger moths couple this kinematic defense with an acoustic reply to a bat's biosonar-guided assault. The jamming hypothesis for the function of these moth sounds assumes that tiger moth clicks presented at high densities, temporally locked to the terminal phase of the bat attack will produce the greatest jamming efficacy. Concomitantly, this hypothesis argues that moths warning bats of bad tasting chemicals sequestered in their tissues should call early to give the bat time to process the meaning of the warning signal and that moths calling at low duty cycles are more likely to employ such an aposematic strategy. We report here the first investigation of a tiger moth assemblage's response to playback of a bat echolocation attack sequence. This assemblage of arctiid moths first answered the echolocation attack sequence 960+/-547 ms (mean +/- s.d.) from the end of the bat attack. The assemblage reached a half-maximum response shortly after the first response, at 763+/-479 ms from the end of the terminal buzz. Tiger moth response reached a maximum at 475+/-344 ms from the end of the sequence; during the approach phase, well before the onset of the terminal buzz. In short, much of tiger moth response to bat attack occurs outside of the jamming hypotheses' predictions. Furthermore, no relationship exists between the duty cycle of a tiger moth's call (and thus the call's probability of jamming the bat) and its temporal response to bat attack. These data call into doubt the assumptions behind the jamming hypothesis as currently stated but do not directly test the functionality of arctiid sounds in disrupting echolocation in bat-moth aerial battles.},

Each tymbal is a swollen air-filled katepisternal sclerite with a vertical band of 15 to 20 striae on its anterior outer face. When compressed vertically by the basalar musculature it buckles inwards along the line of the striated band, which may be regarded as a linear array of 'microtymbals '. Each stria produces a click which excites the whole structure into damped resonance and yields a brief pulse of sound with a half-decay time of about 80 $\mu$s. Muscle contraction and relaxation produce a cycle of modulation both of pulse repetition rate, up to 1200/s, and of frequency over about an octave as a result of stress changes in the band. The audible fundamental component is relatively weak, and most energy is generated between 30 and 90 kc/s. Bursts of tymbal activity comprise from one to 20 modulation cycles. The acoustic performance of the tymbal organ is compared to that of a simple mechanical model. Previous accounts of the structures are summarized and the possible significance of the sounds discussed.},

We describe low-noise design techniques that help the neural amplifier achieve input-referred noise that is near the theoretical limit of any amplifier using a differential pair as an input stage. Since neural amplifiers must include differential input pairs in practice to allow robust rejection of common-mode and power supply noise, our design appears to be near the optimum allowed by theory. The bandwidth of the amplifier can be adjusted for recording either neural spikes or local field potentials (LFPs). When configured for recording neural spikes, the amplifier yielded a midband gain of 40.8 dB and a -3-dB bandwidth from 45 Hz to 5.32 kHz; the amplifier's input-referred noise was measured to be 3.06 muVrms while consuming 7.56 muW of power from a 2.8-V supply corresponding to a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 2.67 with the theoretical limit being 2.02. When configured for recording LFPs, the amplifier achieved a midband gain of 40.9 dB and a -3-dB bandwidth from 392 mHz to 295 Hz; the input-referred noise was 1.66 muVrms while consuming 2.08 muW from a 2.8-V supply corresponding to an NEF of 3.21. The amplifier was fabricated in AMI's 0.5-mum CMOS process and occupies 0.16 mm2 of chip area. We obtained successful recordings of action potentials from the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) of an anesthesized zebra finch brain with the amplifier.

  abstract = {This methodological paper provides a detailed description of a novel ultralow- noise pre- and main-amplifi er system designed for the extracellular recording of voltage spikes produced by neuronal action potentials. The main difficulties with extracellular recording are the unwanted electrical signals that lower the recording quality. They include destructive interferences by alternating electric or magnetic fields, in addition to thermal and other random noises resulting from the intrinsic properties of the substances from which the electrode and the electrical circuit are made. The preamplifier is placed in a specially built metal headstage probe. It is designed so that microelectrodes can be plugged directly into the probe, keeping the electrode and preamplifi er in the closest possible proximity. Unique electrode holder adaptors at the same time make the probe for the electrode holder with the added benefi t of extended electrical shielding. The main amplifier contains tuned circuit band pass fi lters optimized for metal and carbon fiber microelectrodes. Electromagnetic interference pickup is reduced by the enclosing tin-plated iron box and a built-in 50/60 Hz reject fi lter. In test experiments, an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and low-noise baseline recording were achieved. When carbon fiber microelectrodes were applied in the medulla of anesthetized rats, the total peak-to-peak noise level of the system was about 25 $\mathrm{\mu}$V, i.e., about 6 $\mathrm{\mu}$V RMS, which is only a few $\mathrm{\mu}$V higher than the theoretical random noise. It is concluded that, in combination with carbon fi ber electrodes, the present amplifiers do not contribute significantly to the overall noise.},

  abstract = {Male moths of the chloephorine species Pseudoips prasinana and Bena bicolorana produce clicks (approximately 100 dB peSPL at 10 cm) using ventral tymbal organs located in a cleft in the second abdominal sternite. Large muscles insert on the dorsal part of the tymbal frame and rhythmically flex a thin sheet of cuticle. Normally, each sound-production cycle contains four clicks, the left and right tymbals producing clicks both on active buckling caused by muscle contraction and on the passive elastic return from buckling. Histochemical staining indicated the presence of elastic resilin-like proteins in the tymbals. Obvious differences between the click patterns of the two species reflect differences in their tymbal morphology. P. prasinana has smooth tymbals and produces a single click (300 $\mathrm{\mu}$s, 40 kHz) for each tymbal buckling. In contrast, B. bicolorana has striae on the medial part of the tymbals. Accordingly, it produces many clicks per buckling. The click pattern is a heterogeneous mixture of large clicks at 52 kHz, resembling those of P. prasinana, interspersed with series of broad-band clicks (20-100 kHz) of lower intensity (15-20 dB). Thus, in chloephorine moths, there is a correlation between the structure and function of the smooth and striated tymbals that is strikingly similar to that in arctiid moths, although the two types of tymbals have evolved independently. The hearing of P. prasinana is tuned to its own sounds with lowest threshold (38 dB SPL) at 40-60 kHz. We suggest that sound production in male chloephorines plays a part in sexual acoustic communication.},

  abstract = {Anatomy and physiology instructors often face the daunting task of teaching the principles of neurophysiology as part of a laboratory course with very limited resources. Teaching neurophysiology can be a difficult undertaking as sophisticated electrophysiology and data acquisition equipment is often financially out-of-reach for two-year institutions, and for many preparations, instructors need to be highly skilled in electrophysiology techniques when teaching hands-on laboratories. In the absence of appropriate laboratory tools, many undergraduate students have difficulty understanding concepts related to neurophysiology. The cricket can serve as a reliable invertebrate model to teach the basic concepts of neurophysiology in the educational laboratory. In this manuscript, we describe a series of hands-on, demonstrative, technologically simple, and affordable laboratory activities that will help undergraduate students gain an understanding of the principles of neurophysiology. By using the cerci ganglion and leg preparation, students can quantify extracellular neural activity in response to sensory stimulation, understand the principles of rate coding and somatotopy, perform electrical microstimulation to understand the threshold of sensory stimulation, and do pharmacological manipulation of neuronal activity. We describe the utility of these laboratory activities, provide a convenient protocol for quantifying extracellular recordings, and discuss feedback provided by undergraduate students with regards to the quality of the educational experience after performing the lab activities.},

  abstract = {The cost of electronic equipment can be a critical barrier to including neurophysiology exercises in biology teaching programs. We describe the construction of a simple and inexpensive AC preamplifier with performance comparable to that of commercial products. The amplifier consists of two integrated circuits in five stages: differential input, fixed gain, variable gain (100 or 1000), low-pass filter (5 or 20 kHz), and 50 or 60 Hz notch filter. We compared our amplifier with two commercial units, the A-M Systems Model 1700 and the Grass P15. The quality of extracellular recording from a typical student preparation (spontaneously active crayfish motor nerve) was the same for all three amplifiers, although our amplifier has slightly higher internal noise than the P15 and slightly lower common-mode rejection than the 1700 and P15. In addition, we describe a simple suction electrode for extracellular nerve recording. It is easily constructed from readily available materials and uses a disposable plastic pipette tip, instead of the traditional glass tip, to contact the nerve. This tip is easily replaced if broken or clogged, and can be adapted to different recording conditions by selecting a different tip size or stretching the plastic. Development of this equipment is part of an ongoing project to promote neuroscience education by expanding the neurophysiology options available to laboratory instructors.

  abstract = {Spike activity of the B cell, a unit in the tympanic organ of noctuid moths, was monitored during both stationary flight and acoustic stimulation. This neuron was previously considered (Treat and Roeder, 1959) unresponsive to sound and was thought to be a sensor for thoracic deformations accompanying flight movements. The present study did not reveal changes in B cell spike repetition rate related to active wing flapping, but did reveal a decline in the tonic repetition rate with the onset of an acoustic stimulus. Experimental results indicate that this inhibition of B spike activity is, at least in part, indirect, with the acoustic sense cells serving as the primary receptors. B cell inhibition is most marked with rapidly pulsed, relatively intense bursts of ultrasound. Lowintensity continuous tones evoke little or no change in the B spike repetition rate. The relationship between B spike activity and that of the acoustic sense cells (A cells) is complex. There is roughly an inverse correlation between the two spike activities with the onset and with the cessation of an acoustic stimulus, but B spike activity changes during the stimulus with no concomitant change in A cell spike activity. The possible significance of this complex functioning is considered in relation to avoidance behaviour in flying moths. ?? 1971.},

  abstract = {1. Notodontid moths possess paired tympanic organs basically similar to the ears in other noctuoid families, but with a single auditory A cell. The A cell and the non-auditory B cell were studied anatomically by infusion of C0CI2 and physiologically by recordings from the tympanic nerve. 2. The response of the A cell is determined by intensity parameters and temporal parameters of an ultrasonic stimulus. The notodontid ear is as sensitive as the ears of sympatric noctuids. The directional sensitivity is approximately the same as in noctuids of comparable size (maximal interaural intensity difference of 10\textendash{}15 dB). The dynamic range of the A cell is about 20\textendash{}25 dB. Sound levels exceeding the threshold by 30\textendash{}40 dB will saturate the A cells in both ears. Stimuli with different pulse lengths (from 5 to 200 ms, corresponding to pulse repetition rates (PRR) from 100-2.5 Hz), but equal duty cycles (50\%) gave a maximum response for pulse lengths lying between 30 and 50 ms. The receptor cell followed the sound pulses in a one-to-one manner even at a PRR of 200 Hz. 3. Notodontid moths seem to show the same `bimodal' evasive behaviour as noctuids. This behaviour can be explained on the basis of intensity parameters, since only low intensity stimuli will give the notodontid directional information. Hence, directional evasive behaviour is expected at low sound pressure levels (SPL), while high SPL (saturating both A cells) should elicit a non-directional evasive behaviour. However, the evasive behaviour could also be explained in terms of time parameters. Hunting bats increase the PRR of their cries when closing in on a prey and the moths may be able to use these time cues for changing their behaviour.},

  abstract = {This study presents anatomical and physiological evidence for a sense of hearing in hooktip moths (Drepanoidea). Two example species, Drepana arcuata and Watsonalla uncinula, were examined. The abdominal ears of drepanids are structurally unique compared to those of other Lepidoptera and other insects, by having an internal tympanal membrane, and auditory sensilla embedded within the membrane. The tympanum is formed by two thin tracheal walls that stretch across a teardrop-shaped opening between dorsal and ventral air chambers in the first abdominal segment. There are four sensory organs (scolopidia) embedded separately between the tympanal membrane layers: two larger lateral scolopidia within the tympanal area, and two smaller scolopidia at the medial margin of the tympanal frame. Sound is thought to reach the tympanal membrane through two external membranes that connect indirectly to the dorsal chamber. The ear is tuned to ultrasonic frequencies between 30 and 65 kHz, with a best threshold of around 52 dB SPL at 40 kHz, and no apparent difference between genders. Thus, drepanid hearing resembles that of other moths, indicating that the main function is bat detection. Two sensory cells are excited by sound stimuli. Those two cells differ in threshold by approximately 19 dB. The morphology of the ear suggests that the two larger scolopidia function as auditory sensilla; the two smaller scolopidia, located near the tympanal frame, were not excited by sound. We present a biophysical model to explain the possible functional organization of this unique tympanal ear.},

This sound is produced by a hitherto unknown type of sound organ located in the last abdominal (genital) segment, which may act as a tymbal. The observed directionality of sound output is probably achieved by means of a hollow cone surrounding the sound organ. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the tympanal organs of S. minoralis are most sensitive in the frequency range from 50 to at least 100 kHz, which is distinctly higher than the minimum threshold levels in most other moths yet examined. The origin of genital sound production is discussed with respect to abdominal pheromone glands and pheromone-releasing movements.},

Females react to both the male song and bat calls by "freezing", which males take advantage of in mating (deceptive courtship song). In contrast, females of the Japanese lichen moth are able to distinguish between the male song and bat calls by the structure of the sounds; females emit warning clicks against bats, but accept males (true courtship song). Here, we propose a hypothesis that deceptive and true signals evolved independently from slightly different precursory sounds; deceptive/true courtship songs in moths evolved from the sounds males incidentally emitted in a sexual context, which females could not/could distinguish, respectively, from bat calls.},

The noctuid moth, Ascalapha odorata, tested in Kauai and compared to individuals from Panama, a tropical high bat diversity site, shows significant differences which resemble the species-assemblage comparisons (i.e., reduced high frequency sensitivity and increased low frequency sensitivity). Free-flying moths exhibited a variety of evasive flight maneuvers to escape the predatory attacks of L. c. semotus. The auditory characteristics of Kauaian moths suggests that these insects detect both this bat's 9.8 kHz, social call and its 27.9 kHz, echolocation signal.

  abstract = {Many noctuid moths turn in free flight and assume a course away from a source of faint ultrasonic pulses. This avoidance behaviour appears to be steered primarily by a difference in the afferent signals delivered by one acoustic (A1) sense cell in each tympanic organ. This paper reports the first or `afferent' stage of an attempt to trace functional interneuronal connexions made by the A fibres in the moth's central nervous system. The A fibres distribute signals ipsilaterally within the three thoracic ganglia. They connect with relay (R) neurons that convey the afferent signal with minor transformation to other ipsi- and contralateral regions of the meso- and prothoracic ganglia and to the ipsilateral cervical connectives. The posterior medial part of the mesothoracic ganglion appears to be a site for various types of integration of the afferent signal. This takes the form of discarding certain parameters of the stimulus and retaining others. Ultrasonic frequency is discarded in the neural signal generated by the A cells. Their signal is in turn transformed by pulse-marker (PM) neurons so that pulse intensity and duration are discarded, leaving only pulse repetition rate in the PM response. A, R, and PM units respond unilaterally, that is, only to the stimulation of one ear. Other neural units summate signals from right and left ears, while still others respond with a tonic discharge unphased by the repetition rate of the stimulus. Inhibitory phenomena have not yet been encountered.},

  abstract = {Tympanal ears of female gypsy moths Lymantria dispar dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae: Lymantriinae) are reportedly more sensitive than ears of con-specific males to sounds below 20 kHz. The hypothesis is tested that this differential sensitivity is a result of sex-specific functional roles of sound during sexual communica-tion, with males sending and females receiving acoustic signals. Analyses of sounds pro-duced by flying males reveal a 33-Hz wing beat frequency and 14-kHz associated clicks, which remain unchanged in the presence of female sex pheromone. Females exposed to playback sounds of flying conspecific males respond with wing raising, fluttering and walking, generating distinctive visual signals that may be utilized by mate-seeking males at close range. By contrast, females exposed to playback sounds of flying heterospecific males (Lymantria fumida Butler) do not exhibit the above behavioural responses. Laser Doppler vibrometry reveals that female tympana are particularly sensitive to frequen-cies in the range produced by flying conspecific males, including the 33-Hz wing beat frequency, as well as the 7-kHz fundamental frequency and 14-kHz dominant frequency of associated clicks. These results support the hypothesis that the female L. dispar ear is tuned to sounds of flying conspecific males. Based on previous findings and the data of the present study, sexual communication in L. dispar appears to proceed as: (i) females emitting sex pheromone that attracts males; (ii) males flying toward calling females; and (iii) sound signals from flying males at close range inducing movement in females, which, in turn, provides visual signals that could orient males toward females.},

  abstract = {1. The central projections of the A1 afferent were confirmed via intracellular recording and staining with Lucifer Yellow in the pterothoracic ganglion of the noctuid moths, Agrotis infusa and Apamea amputatrix (Fig. 1). Simultaneous recordings of the A1 afferent in the tympanal nerve (extracellularly) and in the pterothoracic ganglion (intracellularly) confirm the identity of the stained receptor as being the A1 cell. 2. The major postsynaptic arborizations of interneurone 501 in the pterothoracic ganglion were also demonstrated via intracellular recording and staining (Fig. 2). Simultaneous recordings of the A1 afferent (extracellularly) and neurone 501 (intracellularly) revealed that each A1 spike evokes a constant short latency EPSP in the interneurone (Fig. 2Bi). Neurone 501 receives only monaural input from the A1 afferent on its soma side as demonstrated by electrical stimulation of each afferent nerve (Fig. 2Bii). EPSPs evoked in neurone 501 by high frequency (100 Hz) electrical stimulation of the afferent nerve did not decrement (Fig. 2Biii). These data are consistent with a monosynaptic input to neurone 501 from the A1 afferent. 3. The response of neurone 501 to a sound stimulus presented at an intensity near the upper limit of its linear response range (30 ms, 16 kHz, 80 dB SPL) was a plateau-like depolarization, with tonic spiking activity which continued beyond the end of the tone. The instantaneous spike frequency of the response was as high as 800 Hz, and was maintained at above 600 Hz for the duration of the tone (Fig. 3). 4. The relationship between the instantaneous spike frequency in the A1 afferent and that recorded simultaneously in neurone 501 is linear over the entire range of A1 spike frequencies evoked by white noise sound stimuli (Fig. 4). Similarly, the relationship between instantaneous spike frequency in the A1 afferent and the mean depolarization evoked in neurone 501 is also linear for all A1 spike frequencies tested (Fig. 5). No summation of EPSPs occurred for A1 spike frequencies below 100 Hz.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Acoustic communication often involves complex sound motifs in which the relative durations of individual elements, but not their absolute durations, convey meaning. Decoding such signals requires an explicit or implicit calculation of the ratios between time intervals. Using grasshopper communication as a model, we demonstrate how this seemingly difficult computation can be solved in real time by a small set of auditory neurons. One of these cells, an ascending interneuron, generates bursts of action potentials in response to the rhythmic syllable-pause structure of grasshopper calls. Our data show that these bursts are preferentially triggered at syllable onset; the number of spikes within the burst is linearly correlated with the duration of the preceding pause. Integrating the number of spikes over a fixed time window therefore leads to a total spike count that reflects the characteristic syllable-to-pause ratio of the species while being invariant to playing back the call faster or slower. Such a timescale-invariant recognition is essential under natural conditions, because grasshoppers do not thermoregulate; the call of a sender sitting in the shade will be slower than that of a grasshopper in the sun. Our results show that timescale-invariant stimulus recognition can be implemented at the single-cell level without directly calculating the ratio between pulse and interpulse durations.},

  abstract = {In certain nocturnal moth species the frequency range of best hearing shifts to higher frequencies during repeated sound stimulation. This could provide the moths with a mechanism to better detect approaching echolocating bats. However, such a dynamic up-tuning would be of little value for day-flying moths that use intra-specific acoustic communication. Here we examined if the ears of day-flying moths provide stable tuning during longer sound stimulation. Contrary to our expectations, dynamic up-tuning was found in the ear of the day-flying species Urania boisduvalii and Empyreuma pugione. Audiograms were measured with distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The level of the dominant distortion product (i.e. 2f1\textendash{}f2) varied as a function of time by as much as 45 dB during ongoing acoustic stimulation, showing a systematic decrease at low frequencies and an increase at high frequencies. As a consequence, within about 2 s of acoustic stimulation, the DPOAEs audiogram shifted from low to high frequencies. Despite the up-tuning, the range of best audition still fell within the frequency band of the species-specific communication signals, suggesting that intra-specific communication should not be affected adversely. Up-tuning could be an ancestral condition in moth ears that in day-flying moths does not underlie larger selection pressure.},

Larger moths also have lower A1 best thresholds, allowing them to detect bats at greater distances and possibly compensating for their increased conspicuousness. Interestingly, the sound frequency at the lowest threshold is lower in larger than in smaller moths, suggesting that the relationship between threshold and size might vary across frequencies used by different bat species. Here, we demonstrate that the relationships between threshold and size in moths were only significant at some frequencies, and these frequencies differed between three locations (UK, Canada and Denmark). The relationships were more likely to be significant at call frequencies used by proportionately more bat species in the moths' specific bat community, suggesting an association between the tuning of moth ears and the cues provided by sympatric predators. Additionally, we found that the best threshold and best frequency of the less sensitive A2 receptor are also related to size, and that these relationships hold when controlling for evolutionary relationships. The slopes of best threshold versus size differ, however, such that the difference in threshold between A1 and A2 is greater for larger than for smaller moths. The shorter time from A1 to A2 excitation in smaller than in larger moths could potentially compensate for shorter absolute detection distances in smaller moths.},

  abstract = {Insects are capable of detecting a broad range of acoustic signals transmitted through air, water, or solids. Auditory sensory organs are morphologically diverse with respect to their body location, accessory structures, and number of sensilla, but remarkably uniform in that most are innervated by chordotonal organs. Chordotonal organs are structurally complex Type I mechanoreceptors that are distributed throughout the insect body and function to detect a wide range of mechanical stimuli, from gross motor movements to air-borne sounds. At present, little is known about how chordotonal organs in general function to convert mechanical stimuli to nerve impulses, and our limited understanding of this process represents one of the major challenges to the study of insect auditory systems today. This report reviews the literature on chordotonal organs innervating insect ears, with the broad intention of uncovering some common structural specializations of peripheral auditory systems, and identifying new avenues for research. A general overview of chordotonal organ ultrastructure is presented, followed by a summary of the current theories on mechanical coupling and transduction in monodynal, mononematic, Type 1 scolopidia, which characteristically innervate insect ears. Auditory organs of different insect taxa are reviewed, focusing primarily on tympanal organs, and with some consideration to Johnston's and subgenual organs. It is widely accepted that insect hearing organs evolved from pre-existing proprioceptive chordotonal organs. In addition to certain non-neural adaptations for hearing, such as tracheal expansion and cuticular thinning, the chordotonal organs themselves may have intrinsic specializations for sound reception and transduction, and these are discussed. In the future, an integrated approach, using traditional anatomical and physiological techniques in combination with new methodologies in immunohistochemistry, genetics, and biophysics, will assist in refining hypotheses on how chordotonal organs function, and, ultimately, lead to new insights into the peripheral mechanisms underlying hearing in insects.},

  abstract = {Many arctiid and ctenuchid moths produce clicking sounds in response to the ultrasonic cries of bats. Clicks were recorded from the 2 arctiid moth species A. caja, the garden tiger, and Phragmatobia fuliginosa, the ruby tiger. The threshold for eliciting clicks was around 60-75 dB pe SPL (peak equivalent sound pressure level) in both species. A. caja produced single clicks, and P. fuliginosa bursts of clicks. The maximum intensity of the clicks was 90-94 dB pe SPL at 5 cm for A. caja and 85 dB pe SPL at 5 cm for P. fuliginosa. The clicks contain most energy in the frequency range from 40 to 80 kHz. Pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) were trained to sit on a platform and discriminate the difference in range, .DELTA.d, to 2 targets. The minimum .DELTA.d the bats could discriminate with more than 75\% success rate was 1.5 cm. The targets had built-in electrostatic loudspeakers through which different sounds could be played back to the bat. Playback of arctiid moth clicks from both targets did not disturb the bat's discrimination accuracy. The success rate did not decrease at any .DELTA.d, and the minimum .DELTA.d in the presence of clicks was 1 cm. The clicks played from both loudspeakers did not influence the acoustic behavior or discrimination behavior of the bats in any obvious way. In all trials the bats went through a period with long (3 ms) slowly repeated  (12-15 pulses/s) cries, a period with shorter cries and increased PRR (20 pulses/s) in which the decision seemed to be made, and finally a period with very short cries (0.5 ms) repeated at rates of up to 150 pulses/s. The cries were FM sweeps from 120 kHz to 55 kHz with a 2nd harmonic, which was strongest in the short cries. The bats' response to the playback of different sounds, such as noise and recorded bat cries, from either the left or right loudspeaker, suggested that the bats reacted to clicks as if they were noise. The playback of sounds from only one speaker at a time decreased the bats' success rate, since the bats were attracted to the sounds. A secretion from the cervical glands of A. caja, which contains choline ester, was given to a bat if it crawled towards a clicking target. Both bats tested in this way learned to associate the clicks with a noxious reward and avoided the clicks after just 1 or 2 trials. Results suggest that the function of the garden tiger and ruby tiger clicks in nature is to warn the bat of the moth's distastefulness, and not to jam the bat's sonar system.},

Through selective pressures from aerial-hawking bats, noctuoid moths have evolved simple ears that contain one to two auditory neurons and function to detect bat echolocation calls and initiate defensive flight behaviours. Among these moths, some chemically defended and mimetic tiger moths also produce ultrasonic clicks in response to bat echolocation calls; these defensive signals are effective warning signals and may interfere with bats' ability to process echoic information. Here, we demonstrate that the activity of a single auditory neuron (the A1 cell) provides sufficient information for the toxic dogbane tiger moth, Cycnia tenera, to decide when to initiate defensive sound production in the face of bats. Thus, despite previous suggestions to the contrary, these moths' only other auditory neuron, the less sensitive A2 cell, is not necessary for initiating sound production. However, we found a positive linear relationship between combined A1 and A2 activity and the number of clicks the dogbane tiger moth produces.},

The dogbane tiger moth, Cycnia tenera, preferentially phonoresponds to the calls produced by attacking versus searching bats, suggesting that it either recognizes some acoustic feature of this phase of the bat's echolocation calls or that it simply reacts to their increased power as the bat closes. Here, we used a habituation/generalization paradigm to demonstrate that C. tenera responds neither to the shift in echolocation call frequencies nor to the change in pulse duration that is exhibited during the bat's attack phase unless these changes are accompanied by either an increase in duty cycle or a decrease in pulse period. To separate these features, we measured the moth's phonoresponse thresholds to pulsed stimuli with variable versus constant duty cycles and demonstrate that C. tenera is most sensitive to echolocation call periods expressed by an attacking bat. We suggest that, under natural conditions, C. tenera identifies an attacking bat by recognizing the pulse period of its echolocation calls but that this feature recognition is influenced by acoustic power and can be overridden by unnaturally intense sounds.},

  abstract = {Lepidoptera evolved tympanic ears in response to echolocating bats. Comparative studies have shown that moth ears evolved many times independently from chordotonal organs. With only 1 to 4 receptor cells, they are one of the simplest hearing organs. The small number of receptors does not imply simplicity, neither in behavior nor in the neural circuit. Behaviorally, the response to ultrasound is far from being a simple reflex. Moths' escape behavior is modulated by a variety of cues, especially pheromones, which can alter the auditory response. Neurally the receptor cell(s) diverges onto many interneurons, enabling parallel processing and feature extraction. Ascending interneurons and sound-sensitive brain neurons innervate a neuropil in the ventrolateral protocerebrum. Further, recent electrophysiological data provides the first glimpses into how the acoustic response is modulated as well as how ultrasound influences the other senses. So far, the auditory pathway has been studied in noctuids. The findings agree well with common computational principles found in other insects. However, moth ears also show unique mechanical and neural adaptation. Here, we first describe the variety of moths' auditory behavior, especially the co-option of ultrasonic signals for intraspecific communication. Second, we describe the current knowledge of the neural pathway gained from noctuid moths. Finally, we argue that Galleriinae which show negative and positive phonotaxis, are an interesting model species for future electrophysiological studies of the auditory pathway and multimodal sensory integration, and so are ideally suited for the study of the evolution of behavioral mechanisms given a few receptors [Current Zoology 61 (2) : \textendash{} , 2015 ].},

  abstract = {Motor neurons innervating the dorsal longitudinal muscles of a noctuid moth receive syn- aptic input activated by auditory stimuli. Each ear of a noctuid moth contains two auditory neurons that are sensitive to ultrasound (Fig. 1). The ears function as bat detectors. Five pairs of large motor neurons and three pairs of small motor neurons found in the pterothoracic ganglia innervate the dorsal longitudinal (depressor) muscles of the me- sothorax (Figs. 2 to 5). In non-flying preparations the motor neurons receive no oscillatory synaptic input. Synaptic input to a cell resulting from ultra- sonic stimulation is consistent and can be either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing (Figs. 6 to 9). Qui- escent neurons only rarely fire a spike in response to auditory inputs. Motor neurons in flying prepa- rations receive oscillatory synaptic drive from the flight pattern generator and usually fire a spike for each wingbeat cycle (Figs. 10 to 12). Ultrasonic stimulation can provide augmented synaptic drive causing a neuron to fire two spikes per wingbeat cycle thus increasing flight vigor (Fig. 11). The same stimulus presented on another occasion can also inhibit spiking in the same motor neuron, but the rhythmic drive remains (Fig. 12). Thus, when the flight oscillator is running auditory stimuli can modulate neuronal responses in different ways de- pending on some unknown state of the nervous system. Sound intensity is the only stimulus param- eter essential for activating the auditory pathway to these motor neurons. The intensity must be suf- ficient to excite two or three auditory neurons. The significance of these responses in relation to avoid- ance behavior to bats is discussed.},

  abstract = {Insect-eating bats find their aerial food by sonar, through emitting ultrasonic chirps and locating sources of echoes. Certain moths have ears sensitive to these chirps and can detect bats well beyond the range of the bats' sonar. On hearing a distant bat, many moths turn and fly directly away from the source of ultrasound. Only one sense cell in each ear of a moth provides the primary nervous information for this response. This article describes my initial attempts to find out how a moth's central nervous system processes the train of chirps reaching its two ears. The ear of a restrained moth is exposed to a sequence of artifically generated ultrasonic pulses that approximates the cries made by a bat. This stimulus can be varied with respect to ultrasonic frequency (pitch), pulse intensity, pulse duration, the interval between pulses, and pulse-train duration. The more sensitive acoustic sense cell responds to all frequencies between about 15,000 and 80,000 cycles per second, but the signal that it transmits to the moth's central nervous system contains no measure of frequency within this range. However, this nerve signal reports variations in the other parameters of the stimulus. The acoustic fiber connects, in the central nervous system, with various nerve cells that transform the signal farther. The signal from a pulse-marker neuron contains no measures of pulse intensity or pulse duration, reporting only changes in interpulse interval and pulse-train duration. A train-marker neuron reports only the duration of the pulse train. The stimulus parameters may be likened to keys, each of which is necessary to gain admittance through a given door but becomes superfluous once this door has been passed. This analogy suggests one of the ways in which a signal is transformed in its passage through the nervous system, and how its specificity is assured in eliciting a given response. In addition to undergoing this kind of transformation, neural signals generated in the two directionally sensitive ears must be combined if a flying moth is to steer a course away from a distant bat. Neurons have been discovered in the central ganglia which summate signals from the right and left ears. Other neurons are inhibited in their activity by stimulation of one ear. The moth may combine signals from these neurons with motor-nerve information on the attitude of its own wings, which act as oscillating baffles modifying its directional acoustic sensitivity 20 to 40 times a second as it flaps an erratic path through the darkness.},

By comparison, acoustic mimicry has never been rigorously tested. Visualizing bat-moth interactions with high-speed, infrared videography, we provide empirical evidence for acoustic mimicry in the ultrasonic warning sounds that tiger moths produce in response to echolocating bats. Two species of sound-producing tiger moths were offered successively to na\"ive, free-flying red and big brown bats. Noctuid and pyralid moth controls were also offered each night. All bats quickly learned to avoid the noxious tiger moths first offered to them, associating the warning sounds with bad taste. They then avoided the second sound-producing species regardless of whether it was chemically protected or not, verifying both M\"ullerian and Batesian mimicry in the acoustic modality. A subset of the red bats subsequently discovered the palatability of the Batesian mimic, demonstrating the powerful selective force these predators exert on mimetic resemblance. Given these results and the widespread presence of tiger moth species and other sound-producing insects that respond with ultrasonic clicks to bat attack, acoustic mimicry complexes are likely common components of the acoustic landscape.},

  abstract = {While the sensing of substrate vibrations is common among arthropods, the reception of sound pres- sure waves is an adaptation restricted to insects, which has arisen independently several times in different or- ders. Wherever studied, tympanal organs were shown to derive from chordotonal precursors, which were modi- fied such that mechanosensitive scolopidia became at- tached to thin cuticular membranes backed by air-filled tracheal cavities (except in lacewings). The behavioural context in which hearing has evolved has strongly deter- mined the design and properties of the auditory system. Hearing organs which have evolved in the context of predator avoidance are highly sensitive, preferentially in a broad range of ultrasound frequencies, which release rapid escape manoeuvres. Hearing in the context of com- munication does not only require recognition and dis- crimination of highly specific song patterns but also their localisation. Typically, the spectrum of the conspecific signals matches the best sensitivity of the receiver. Di- rectionality is achieved by means of sophisticated pe- ripheral structures and is further enhanced by neuronal processing. Side-specific gain control typically allows the insect to encode the loudest signal on each side. The filtered information is transmitted to the brain, where the final steps of pattern recognition and localisation occur. The outputs of such filter networks, modulated or gated by further processes (subsumed by the term motivation), trigger command neurones for specific behaviours. Alto- gether, the many improvements opportunistically evolved at any stage of acoustic information-processing ultimately allow insects to come up with astonishing acoustic performances similar to those achieved by ver- tebrates.},

Noctuid moths possess only two auditory receptors (A1, A2), in each ear. The axon of the A1 cell projects initially to a glomerulus located ventrally and medially in the metathoracic ganglion, where it bifurcates. One branch ascends in the ventral intermediate tract to the brain, the other descends in the ventral intermediate tract into abdominal neuromeres of the metathoracic ganglion. Both axons arborize in the median ventral and ring tracts in each neuromere. The central projections of the A2 cell remain largely within the metathoracic ganglion. The axon bifurcates at the midline and directs arborizations dorsally to the dorsal intermediate and median dorsal tracts, and ventrally into the ring tract where the arborizations overlap those of the A1 afferent. The afferent projections remain ipsilateral to the ear of origin. We describe a posterior auditory association area in the metathoracic ganglion in which the major arborizations of several identified interneurones overlap those of the A1 afferent and make monosynaptic connections with it. These interneurones all respond tonically to sound stimuli. We have also identified the projections of the A1 afferent, interneurones, and motor neurones in the segmentally equivalent anterior auditory association area of the mesothoracic ganglion. An interneurone with major arborizations in the same tracts as the A1 afferent, and receiving monosynaptic input from it, is described. The arborizations of higher order interneurones lie mainly in dorsal tracts along with those of flight motor neurones. All the interneurones in this anterior centre respond phasically or phasic/tonically to sound stimuli. The relevance of this anatomical organization for predator avoidance behaviour is considered and the organization of auditory pathways in tympanate insects compared.},

Simulation of wasps with a yellow-black abdominal pattern by other insects (commonly called ``wasp mimicry'') is traditionally considered a case of resemblance of unprofitable by profitable prey causing educated predators to avoid models and mimics to the advantage of both (Figure 1a). However, as wasps themselves are predators of insects, wasp mimicry can also be seen as a case of resemblance to one's own potential antagonist. We here propose an additional hypothesis to Batesian and M\"ullerian mimicry (both typically involving selection by learning vertebrate predators; cf. Table 1) that reflects another possible scenario for the evolution of multifold and in particular very accurate resemblances to wasps: an innate, visual inhibition of aggression among look-alike wasps, based on their social organization and high abundance. We argue that wasp species resembling each other need not only be M\"ullerian mutualists and that other insects resembling wasps need not only be Batesian mimics, but an innate ability of wasps to recognize each other during hunting is the driver in the evolution of a distinct kind of masquerade, in which model, mimic, and selecting agent belong to one or several species (Figure 1b). Wasp mimics resemble wasps not (only) to be mistaken by educated predators but rather, or in addition, to escape attack from their wasp models. Within a given ecosystem, there will be selection pressures leading to masquerade driven by wasps and/or to mimicry driven by other predators that have to learn to avoid them. Different pressures by guilds of these two types of selective agents could explain the widely differing fidelity with respect to the models in assemblages of yellow jackets and yellow jacket look-alikes.},

  abstract = {The simple auditory system of noctuoid moths has long been a model for anti-predator studies in neuroethology, although these ears have rarely been experimentally stimulated by the sounds they would encounter from naturally attacking bats. We exposed the ears of five noctuoid moth species to the pre-recorded echolocation calls of an attacking bat (Eptesicus fuscus) to observe the acoustic encoding of the receptors at this critical time in their defensive behaviour. The B cell is a non-tympanal receptor common to all moths that has been suggested to respond to sound, but we found no evidence of this and suggest that its acoustic responsiveness is an artifact arising from its proprioceptive function. The A1 cell, the most sensitive tympanal receptor in noctuid and arctiid moths and the only auditory receptor in notodontid moths, encodes the attack calls with a bursting firing pattern to a point approximately 150 ms from when the bat would have captured the moth. At this point, the firing of the A1 cell reduces to a non-bursting pattern with longer inter-spike periods, suggesting that the moth may no longer express the erratic flight used to escape very close bats. This may be simply due to the absence of selection pressure on moths for auditory tracking of bat echolocation calls beyond this point. Alternatively, the reduced firing may be due to the acoustic characteristics of attack calls in the terminal phase and an acoustic maneuver used by the bat to facilitate its capture of the moth. Although the role of less sensitive A2 cell remains uncertain in the evasive flight responses of moths it may act as a trigger in eliciting sound production, a close-range anti-bat behaviour in the tiger moth, Cycnia tenera.},

  abstract = {Abstract Active echolocation enables bats to orient and hunt the night sky for insects. As a counter-measure against the severe predation pressure many nocturnal insects have evolved ears sensitive to ultrasonic bat calls. In moths bat-detection was the principal purpose of hear- ing, as evidenced by comparable hearing physiology with best sensitivity in the bat echolocation range, 20\textendash{}60 kHz, across moths in spite of diverse ear morphology. Some eared moths subsequently developed sound-producing organs to warn/startle/jam attacking bats and/or to com- municate intraspecifically with sound. Not only the sounds for interaction with bats, but also mating signals are within the frequency range where bats echolocate, indicating that sound communication developed after hearing by ``sensory exploitation''. Recent findings on moth sound communica- tion reveal that close-range (\textasciitilde{} a few cm) communication with low-intensity ultrasounds ``whispered'' by males dur- ing courtship is not uncommon, contrary to the general notion of moths predominantly being silent. Sexual sound communication in moths may apply to many eared moths, perhaps even a majority. The low intensities and high fre- quencies explain that this was overlooked, revealing a bias towards what humans can sense, when studying (acoustic) communication in animals.},

  abstract = {Many night-flying insects evolved ultrasound sensitive ears in response to acoustic predation by echolocating bats [1-10]. Noctuid moths are most sensitive to frequencies at 20-40 kHz [6], the lower range of bat ultrasound [5, 11-13]. This may disadvantage the moth because noctuid-hunting bats in particular echolocate at higher frequencies shortly before prey capture [7, 11-13] and thus improve their echolocation and reduce their acoustic conspicuousness [6-10, 12-16]. Yet, moth hearing is not simple; the ear's nonlinear dynamic response shifts its mechanical sensitivity up to high frequencies. Dependent on incident sound intensity, the moth's ear mechanically tunes up and anticipates the high frequencies used by hunting bats. Surprisingly, this tuning is hysteretic, keeping the ear tuned up for the bat's possible return. A mathematical model is constructed for predicting a linear relationship between the ear's mechanical stiffness and sound intensity. This nonlinear mechanical response is a parametric amplitude dependence [17, 18] that may constitute a feature common to other sensory systems. Adding another twist to the coevolutionary arms race between moths and bats, these results reveal unexpected sophistication in one of the simplest ears known and a novel perspective for interpreting bat echolocation calls. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In those that do, the signals are intense and thus well matched for long distance communication. By contrast, males of the Asian corn borer moth (Crambidae) were recently shown to whisper extremely low-intensity ultrasonic courtship songs close to females. Since low sound levels will prevent eavesdropping by predators, parasites and conspecific rivals, we predicted low intensity ultrasound communication to be widespread among moths. Here we tested 13 species of moths including members of the Noctuidae, Arctiidae, Geometridae and Crambidae. Males of nine species, 70\%, produced broadband ultrasound close to females. Peak frequencies ranged from 38 to above 100 kHz. All sounds were of low intensity, 43-76 dB SPL at 1 cm [64+/-10 dB peSPL (mean +/- s.d.), N=9 species]. These quiet and/or hyper-frequency ultrasounds are audible to nearby mates, but inaudible to unintended receivers. Although largely unknown because it is so inconspicuous, acoustic communication using low intensity ultrasound appears to be widespread among hearing moths. Thus, acoustic communication may be the norm rather than the exception.},

For these goals, the auditory pathways of insects represent the computational substrate for object recognition and localization. Before these higher level computations can be executed in more central parts of the nervous system, the signals need to be preprocessed in the auditory periphery. Here, we review peripheral preprocessing along four computational themes rather than discussing specific physiological mechanisms: (1) control of sensitivity by adaptation, (2) recoding of amplitude modulations of an acoustic signal into a labeled-line code (3) frequency processing and (4) conditioning for binaural processing. Along these lines, we review evidence for canonical computations carried out in the peripheral auditory pathway and show that despite the vast diversity of insect hearing, signal processing is governed by common computational motifs and principles.},

  abstract = {Spike-frequency adaptation is a prominent feature of neural dynamics. Among other mechanisms, various ionic currents modulating spike generation cause this type of neural adaptation. Prominent examples are voltage-gated potassium currents (M-type currents), the interplay of calcium currents and intracellular calcium dynamics with calcium-gated potassium channels (AHP-type currents), and the slow recovery from inactivation of the fast sodium current. While recent modeling studies have focused on the effects of specific adaptation currents, we derive a universal model for the firing-frequency dynamics of an adapting neuron that is independent of the specific adaptation process and spike generator. The model is completely defined by the neuron's onset f-I curve, the steady-state f-I curve, and the time constant of adaptation. For a specific neuron, these parameters can be easily determined from electrophysiological measurements without any pharmacological manipulations. At the same time, the simplicity of the model allows one to analyze mathematically how adaptation influences signal processing on the single-neuron level. In particular, we elucidate the specific nature of high-pass filter properties caused by spike-frequency adaptation. The model is limited to firing frequencies higher than the reciprocal adaptation time constant and to moderate fluctuations of the adaptation and the input current. As an extension of the model, we introduce a framework for combining an arbitrary spike generator with a generalized adaptation current.},

Adaptation in general, however, is not sufficient to make a neuron's response independent of the mean intensity of a sensory stimulus, since low frequency components of the stimulus are still transmitted, although with reduced gain. We here show, based on an analytically tractable model, that the response of a neuron is intensity invariant, if the fully adapted steady-state spike-frequency response to constant stimuli is independent of stimulus intensity. Electrophysiological recordings from the AN1, a primary auditory interneuron of crickets, show that for intensities above 60 dB SPL (sound pressure level) the AN1 adapted with a time-constant of approximately 40 ms to a steady-state firing rate of approximately 100 Hz. Using identical random amplitude-modulation stimuli we verified that the AN1's spike-frequency response is indeed invariant to the stimulus' mean intensity above 60 dB SPL. The transfer function of the AN1 is a band pass, resulting from a high-pass filter (cutoff frequency at 4 Hz) due to adaptation and a low-pass filter (100 Hz) determined by the steady-state spike frequency. Thus, fast spike-frequency adaptation can generate intensity invariance already at the first level of neural processing.},

  abstract = {We investigate the transduction of sound stimuli into neural responses and focus on locust auditory receptor cells. As in other mechanosensory model systems, these neurons integrate acoustic inputs over a fairly broad frequency range. To test three alternative hypotheses about the nature of this spectral integration (amplitude, energy, pressure), we perform intracellular recordings while stimulating with superpositions of pure tones. On the basis of online data analysis and automatic feedback to the stimulus generator, we systematically explore regions in stimulus space that lead to the same level of neural activity. Focusing on such iso-firing-rate regions allows for a rigorous quantitative comparison of the electrophysiological data with predictions from the three hypotheses that is independent of nonlinearities induced by the spike dynamics. We find that the dependence of the firing rates of the receptors on the composition of the frequency spectrum can be well described by an energy-integrator model. This result holds at stimulus onset as well as for the steady-state response, including the case in which adaptation effects depend on the stimulus spectrum. Predictions of the model for the responses to bandpass-filtered noise stimuli are verified accurately. Together, our data suggest that the sound-intensity coding of the receptors can be understood as a three-step process, composed of a linear filter, a summation of the energy contributions in the frequency domain, and a firing-rate encoding of the resulting effective sound intensity. These findings set quantitative constraints for future biophysical models.},

The peripheral anatomy of the metathoracic nerve branch, IIIN1b1 was examined in Actias luna with cobalt-lysine and Janus Green B, and compared to its counterpart, IIIN1b (the tympanal branch), in Feltia heralis (Grt.) (Noctuoidea: Noctuidae). The peripheral projections of IIIN1b1 were found to be similar in both species, dividing into three branches, the second (IIIN1b1b) ending as a chordotonal organ. The atympanate organ possesses three sensory cell bodies and three scolopales, and is anchored peripherally via an attachment strand to the undifferentiated membranous region underlying the hindwing alula, which corresponds to the tympanal region of the noctuoid metathorax. Extracellular recordings of the IIIN1b1 nerve in Actias luna revealed a large spontaneously active unit which fired in a regular pattern (corresponding to the noctuoid B cell) and smaller units (corresponding to the noctuoid acoustic A cells) which responded phasically to low frequency sounds (2 kHz) played at high intensities (83-96 dB, SPL) and also responded phasically to raising and lowering movements of the hindwing. We suggest that the chordotonal organ in Actias luna represents the evolutionary prototype to the noctuoid tympanal organ, and that it acts as a proprioceptor monitoring hindwing movements. This system, in its simplicity (consisting of only a few neurons) could be a useful model for examining the changes to the nervous system (both central and peripheral) that accompanied the evolutionary development of insect tympanal organs.},

Although the neurophysiology of bat detection has been intensively studied in moths for decades, the relationship between sound-induced movement of the noctuid tympanic membrane and action potentials in the auditory sensory cells (A1 and A2) has received little attention. Using laser Doppler vibrometry, we measured the velocity and displacement of the tympanum in response to pure tone pulses for moths that were intact or prepared for neural recording. When recording from the auditory nerve, the displacement of the tympanum at the neural threshold remained constant across frequencies, whereas velocity varied with frequency. This suggests that the key biophysical parameter for triggering action potentials in the sensory cells of noctuid moths is tympanum displacement, not velocity. The validity of studies on the neurophysiology of moth hearing rests on the assumption that the dissection and recording procedures do not affect the biomechanics of the ear. There were no consistent differences in tympanal velocity or displacement when moths were intact or prepared for neural recordings for sound levels close to neural threshold, indicating that this and other neurophysiological studies provide good estimates of what intact moths hear at threshold.},

  abstract = {Temporal coding in the moth ear was inferred from the response of the auditory receptor to acoustic stimuli with different temporal characteristics. 1. Determinations of the threshold with different stimulus pulse durations showed that the moth ear behaves as an energy detector with a maximum time constant (the integration time) of 25 ms. Pulse durations beyond this value did not result in decreased thresholds (Fig. 1). 2. The synchronization to amplitude modulations was determined by stimulating the moth ear with amplitude modulated (AM) tones (carrier frequency: 40 kHz) and AM white noise presented as 450 ms pulses separated by pauses of similar length. The modulation depth was constant (100\%) whereas the modulation frequency,f m, was varied. The maximumf m which the auditory receptors could follow was 200 Hz (P$<$0.05) (Figs. 2, 3, 4). 3. The relatively broad tuning of the only receptor which was functional at the relevant stimulus intensities suggested that AM detection could only be based on temporal cues. This was confirmed by the results showing the same degree of synchronization independent of carrier. 4. A minimum time constant for the receptor was also determined by interrupting a 400 ms noise pulse by a gap (Figs. 5, 6). The threshold for gap detection of the moth ear was ca. 2 ms on a 2.5\% significance level (one sided test). 5. The temporal acuity reported here seems to be fine enough to explain the temporal resolution suggested by behavioral results from other insect species. The results are discussed in relation to acoustic communication in insects as well as in relation to temporal resolution in vertebrates.},

These data were used to construct curves relating the response/intensity characteristics of the less sensitive acoustic sense cells to that of the most sensitive unit, A1. The A2 sense cells of the noctuids were found to be from 20 to 30 dB less sensitive than A1 at sound frequencies to which these ears are most sensitive. In the geometrid it was found that the A2 sense cell was 15 dB less sensitive than A1 and 12 dB more sensitive than A3. Only traces of the response of the fourth geometrid acoustic sense cell (A4) could be identified at high sound intensities. In both noctuids and geometrids the acoustic sensitivity of A2 relative to A1 remained unchanged when tested at selected ultrasonic frequencies between 28 and 50 kHz. This confirms the conclusion that the ears of these moths are incapable of pitch discrimination over this frequency range. Each of the systems had a dynamic range of 40 to 45 dB, that of the geometrid showing greater range overlap of the four A cells and hence greater capacity for sound intensity discrimination. ?? 1974.},

  abstract = {We studied the efficiency and effects of the multiple sensory cues of tiger moths on echolocating bats. We used the northern long-eared bat, Myotis septentrionalis, a purported moth specialist that takes surface-bound prey (gleaning) and airborne prey (aerial hawking), and the dogbane tiger moth, Cycnia tenera, an eared species unpalatable to bats that possesses conspicuous colouration and sound-producing organs (tymbals). This is the first study to investigate the interaction of tiger moths and wild-caught bats under conditions mimicking those found in nature and to demand the use of both aerial hawking and gleaning strategies by bats. Further, it is the first to report spectrograms of the sounds produced by tiger moths while under aerial attack by echolocating bats. During both aerial hawking and gleaning trials, all muted C. tenera and perched intact C. tenera were attacked by M. septentrionalis, indicating that M. septentrionalis did not discriminate C. tenera from palatable moths based on potential echoic and/or non-auditory cues. Intact C. tenera were attacked significantly less often than muted C. tenera during aerial hawking attacks: tymbal clicks were therefore an effective deterrent in an aerial hawking context. During gleaning attacks, intact and muted C. tenera were always attacked and suffered similar mortality rates, suggesting that while handling prey this bat uses primarily chemical signals. Our results also show that C. tenera temporally matches the onset of click production to the ;approach phase' echolocation calls produced by aerial hawking attacking bats and that clicks themselves influence the echolocation behaviour of attacking bats. In the context of past research, these findings support the hypotheses that the clicks of arctiid moths are both an active defence (through echolocation disruption) and a reliable indicator of chemical defence against aerial-hawking bats. We suggest these signals are specialized for an aerial context.},

The method is parameter free, time scale independent and easy to visualize as illustrated by an application to real neuronal spike trains obtained in vitro from rat slices. In a comparison with existing approaches on spike trains extracted from a simulated Hindemarsh\textendash{}Rose network, the ISI-distance performs as well as the best time-scale-optimized measure based on spike timing.},

Echolocation in bats and high-frequency hearing in their insect prey make bats and insects an ideal system for studying the sensory ecology and neuroethology of predator\textendash{}prey interactions. Here, we review the evolutionary history of bats and eared insects, focusing on the insect order Lepidoptera, and consider the evidence for antipredator adaptations and predator counter-adaptations. Ears evolved in a remarkable number of body locations across insects, with the original selection pressure for ears differing between groups. Although cause and effect are difficult to determine, correlations between hearing and life history strategies in moths provide evidence for how these two variables influence each other. We consider life history variables such as size, sex, circadian and seasonal activity patterns, geographic range and the composition of sympatric bat communities. We also review hypotheses on the neural basis for anti-predator behaviours (such as evasive flight and sound production) in moths. It is assumed that these prey adaptations would select for counter-adaptations in predatory bats. We suggest two levels of support for classifying bat traits as counter-adaptations: traits that allow bats to eat more eared prey than expected based on their availability in the environment provide a low level of support for counter-adaptations, whereas traits that have no other plausible explanation for their origination and maintenance than capturing defended prey constitute a high level of support. Specific predator counter-adaptations include calling at frequencies outside the sensitivity range of most eared prey, changing the pattern and frequency of echolocation calls during prey pursuit, and quiet, or `stealth', echolocation.},

Tympanal sound receptors in moths evolved in response to selective pressures provided by echolocating insectivorous bats. The presence of these ultrasound detectors also set the stage for the later evolution of ultrasonic courtship signals in the tympanate moth families. Male moths have repeatedly exploited the bat-detection mechanisms in females for the purpose of finding, identifying and obtaining mates. Ultrasonic courtship has been described in several members of the moth families Arctiidae, Noctuidae and Pyralidae, and ultrasound is predicted to play a significant role in the courtship of other tympanate moths including the Sphingidae, Lymantriidae, Notodontidae and Geometridae. Ultrasonic signals are involved in species recognition, in male-male competition for mates and in female mate-choice systems. Pre-existing motor systems, including those involved in bat defence, have also been exploited for the purpose of generating high-frequency courtship signals. Sound production mechanisms in moths include thoracic tymbals, tegular tymbals, alar castanets and genital stridulatory organs. Thus, in both their sensory and motor aspects, the weapons of bat/moth warfare have frequently evolved into components of courtship systems.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of insect peripheral auditory systems focusing on tympanate ears (pressure detectors) and emphasizing research during the last 15 years. The theme throughout is the evolution of hearing in insects. Ears have appeared independently no fewer than 19 times in the class Insecta and are located on various thoracic and abdominal body segments, on legs, on wings, and on mouth parts. All have fundamentally similar structures\textemdash{}a tympanum backed by a tracheal sac and a tympanal chordotonal organ\textemdash{}though they vary widely in size, ancillary structures, and number of chordotonal sensilla. Novel ears have recently been discovered in praying mantids, two families of beetles, and two families of flies. The tachinid flies are especially notable because they use a previously unknown mechanism for sound localization. Developmental and comparative studies have identified the evolutionary precursors of the tympanal chordotonal organs in several insects; they are uniformly chordotonal proprioceptors. Tympanate species fall into clusters determined by which of the embryologically defined chordotonal organ groups in each body segment served as precursor for the tympanal organ. This suggests that the many appearances of hearing could arise from changes in a small number of developmental modules. The nature of those developmental changes that lead to a functional insect ear is not yet known. Microsc. Res. Tech. 47:380\textendash{}400, 1999. ௠ 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

While frequency-matched (syntonic) bats exert the primary pressure that determines where a sypatric moth's best frequency (BF) lies, there are bats that echolocate in mismatched (allotonic) bandwidths forming selection pressures strong enough to warrant increased secondary sensitivity at these frequencies. It is unknown what neural mechanism is used by these insects to broaden their audiograms but for some neotropical moths, external hearing aids provide a mechanical means of obtaining this sensitivity. Recent studies have uncovered social uses for auditory systems in certain moths and these requirements may provide additional selection pressure. Auditory conditions exist in certain moths that should provide a means to study the evolution of this sensory system from its mechanoreceptor origins to its degeneration in the absence of bat predation.},

On average, bats captured 69\% of the moths they attacked. Moths that exhibited evasive behaviour were caught significantly less often than those that did not (52 vs. 2\%). Moths whose tympanic organs had been punctured were significantly easier to catch (requiring fewer attempts) than moths with intact ears, reflecting the fact that significantly more of the eared than the deafened moths showed evasive behaviour (48 vs. 0\%).

The tiger moth Bertholdia trigona is the only animal in nature known to defend itself by jamming the sonar of its predators \textendash{} bats. In this study we analyzed the three-dimensional flight paths and echolocation behavior of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) attacking B. trigona in a flight room over seven consecutive nights to determine the acoustic mechanism of the sonar-jamming defense. Three mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the phantom echo hypothesis, which states that bats misinterpret moth clicks as echoes; (2) the ranging interference hypothesis, which states that moth clicks degrade the bats' precision in determining target distance; and (3) the masking hypothesis, which states that moth clicks mask the moth echoes entirely, making the moth temporarily invisible. On nights one and two of the experiment, the bats appeared startled by the clicks; however, on nights three through seven, the bats frequently missed their prey by a distance predicted by the ranging interference hypothesis ($\sim$15\textendash{}20 cm). Three-dimensional simulations show that bats did not avoid phantom targets, and the bats' ability to track clicking prey contradicts the predictions of the masking hypothesis. The moth clicks also forced the bats to reverse their stereotyped pattern of echolocation emissions during attack, even while bats continued pursuit of the moths. This likely further hinders the bats' ability to track prey. These results have implications for the evolution of sonar jamming in tiger moths, and we suggest evolutionary pathways by which sonar jamming may have evolved from other tiger moth defense mechanisms.},

In natural contexts, however, PAs cause few or no problems. Rather, these plant secondary metabolites are important elements of ecosystems and plant\textendash{}animal relationships; the existence and persistence of many PA-adapted organisms, in various ways, depends on the presence of PA-containing plants or even on PAs as such. PA plants are widely distributed among unrelated families of the plant kingdom; there is great structural diversity of PAs, and the amounts of PAs produced are subject to great variation due to multiple causes. These realities, coupled with many deficiencies in our scientific understanding, make the presence and roles of PAs in nature a subject with limited potential for valid generalisations and predictions, and complex and difficult to summarise. PAs, their producer plants and their users are integral parts of ecosystems worldwide, and we have to learn to live with these allelochemicals by accepting the presence of some harmful natural chemicals in the environment and by taking regulatory action to reduce health risks to humans. Regulations for consumer protection are long overdue. However, any such measures must be flexible enough to accommodate the findings of future research. Transdisciplinary efforts are required to fill gaps in the knowledge and to come up with additional means to monitor the presence of PAs in food and feed.},

  abstract = {Phase locking of neural firing is ubiquitously observed in the brain and occurs when neurons fire at a particular phase of a periodic signal. Here we study in detail how spikes of single neurons can simultaneously lock to multiple distinct frequencies at the example of p-type electroreceptor afferents in the electrosensory system of the Gymnotiform weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. We identify key elements for multiple frequency locking, study its determining factors and limits, and provide concise mathematical models reproducing our main findings. Our findings provide another example how rate and temporal codes can coexist and complement each other in single neurons, and demonstrate that sensory coding in p-type electroreceptor afferents provides a much richer representation of the sensory environment than commonly assumed. Since the underlying mechanisms are not specific to the electrosensory system, our results could provide the basis for studying multiple-frequency locking in other systems.},
